## Reimbursement rates

The Department pays foster care maintenance reimbursements beginning on the date the department places children or youth in a licensed or certified foster home and each night children or youth reside in the home.

Rates vary based both on child or youth age and their needs as diagnosed by a licensed health care provider. All children or youth placed in foster care receive the basic foster care maintenance payment for their age category. There are six additional levels of supplemental payments, for a total of 7 levels.
