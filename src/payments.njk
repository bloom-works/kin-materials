## Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) 

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) supports families with children experiencing low income. You may be eligible for TANF based on your own income. If you do not qualify for TANF based on your own income, but you are an unlicensed relative caregiver of a foster child, you may be eligible for [non-needy relative TANF.](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/esa/community-services-offices/non-needy-relative-loco-parentis-and-legal-guardian-grant) Applications for non-needy TANF do not consider your income. 

📋Your social worker may assist you with the TANF application, which will be submitted to the DSHS’s [local community services office](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/office-locations) (CSO). 

{% Callout %}
Caregivers cannot receive both TANF benefits on behalf of the child while also receiving foster care reimbursements. Foster care reimbursements are typically higher than TANF. 

⚠️If you receive TANF benefits while completing the licensing process, you will need to inform your CSO once your license has been approved and you begin receiving foster care reimbursements. 
{% endCallout %}

## Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 

Supplemental Security Income pays monthly benefits to people with limited income who have a qualifying disability. Caregivers of children who are blind, deaf, drug affected, diagnosed with medical fragility, disability, or receive special education services are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. 

{% Callout %}
While the child is a dependent of the state of Washington, the Department will receive SSI on behalf of the child.
{% endCallout %}

❌ If the child is in foster care, you are not eligible to receive SSI benefits. 

✅ If you have made an informal caregiving arrangement independent of a state dependency process, then you are eligible to receive SSI for a qualifying child. 

✅ Once a child’s dependency ends, e.g. if you have become a child’s guardian or adoptive parent, then you are eligible to receive SSI for a qualifying child. 

📋 You can complete your SSI application online  or request assistance with the application process from a Social Security representative. 

## Foster care reimbursements

Kinship caregivers can apply to become licensed by the Department, a private Child Placing Agency, or a tribe. Once licensed, caregivers receive [foster care reimbursements](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pubs/LIC_0045.pdf) to help cover the cost of food, clothing, shelter, and personal incidentals.

{% Callout %}
DCYF still encourages caregivers to apply to TANF or non-needy relative TANF in order to receive financial assistance during the licensing process.
{% endCallout %}

## Reimbursement rates

The Department pays foster care maintenance reimbursements beginning on the date the department places children or youth in a licensed or certified foster home and each night children or youth reside in the home.

Rates vary based both on child or youth age and their needs as diagnosed by a licensed health care provider. All children or youth placed in foster care receive the basic foster care maintenance payment for their age category. There are six additional levels of supplemental payments, for a total of 7 levels.

Level 1: Children or youth are developing comparably to children or youth in the same age range.

Level 2: Children or youth require more support from foster parents due to the youth being 12 years of age or older. The payment is based on the youth's needs, who are developing comparably to youth in the same age range.

Level 3: Children or youth are diagnosed with at least one chronic medical condition that requires more support from foster parents due to the severity of their needs. 

Level 4: Children and youth are diagnosed with a developmental disability that requires more support from foster parents due to the severity of their behaviors and needs. 

Level 5: Children and youth are diagnosed with a developmental disability and have at least one chronic health condition. 

Level 6: Have a current mental health diagnosis or current prescription medication to assist with their mental health diagnosis.

Level 7: Have complex mental health needs and need more support to help stabilize and keep the child or youth safe.

## Standardized assessment and appeals

The rate of foster care payment should be determined using the standardized assessment tool: 

- First, within 40 calendar days of placement, AND at least every 6 months after the first assessment, or 
- In the event of significant change in circumstances

You will receive written notification of the payment rate after a standardized assessment is completed. You have a right to request departmental review based on information that was not considered in the assessment. You can also initiate a process to request a department review.

## Steps to receive reimbursement

1. DCYF will send you an invoice each month. Invoices include the number of nights that a child or youth was in your care and any respite hours you may have worked.

3. DCYF will send you a check or initiate a direct deposit to your bank account.
