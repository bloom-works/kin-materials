Always treat the child or youth’s belongings with care and respect. Belongings may include: 

* Clothing
* Mementos
* Bicycles
* Gifts
* Money
* Cultural items

### If the child or youth leaves your home

If the child or youth moves out of your home, make sure they take their personal belongings with them. This includes belongings they brought with them, and belongings they got while they were at your home. 

If they cannot take all their belongings with them:

* Make a plan with their caseworker to return the belongings to them as soon as possible. 
* Store their belongings for at least 30 days after the child or youth leaves your home. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
You do not need to hold onto belongings that the child or youth has outgrown or that are no longer usable. For example, if the child or youth outgrows a clothing item or a toy breaks during placement, we do not expect you to hold onto those items, unless they are significant to the child or youth.
