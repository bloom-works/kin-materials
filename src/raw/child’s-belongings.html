Always treat your kin child’s belongings with care and respect. Examples of belongings include: 

* Clothing
* Mementos
* Bicycles
* Gifts
* Money

### If your kin child leaves your home

If your kin child leaves your home to live somewhere else, make sure they take their personal belongings with them. This includes belongings they brought with them, and belongings they got while they were at your home. 

If they cannot take all their belongings with them:

* Store their belongings for at least 30 days after they leave. 
* Make a plan with the child’s caseworker to return the belongings to the child as soon as possible.
