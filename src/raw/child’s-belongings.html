Always treat the child or youth’s belongings with care and respect. Keeping these items safe and making sure the child or youth has them is important for the child or youth's emotional well-being and sense of stability. The child or youth’s belongings may include: 

* Phones, tablets, and other electronic devices
* Clothing
* Mementos
* Bicycles
* Books
* Gifts
* Money
* Cultural items (such as traditional clothing, religious items, artwork, or instruments)

### If the child or youth leaves your home

We understand this can be a tough and emotional time for you and the child or youth. It's important to recognize your own feelings, get support, and help the child or youth through the transition.

If the child or youth moves out of your home, make sure they take their personal belongings with them. This includes belongings they brought with them, and belongings they got while they were at your home. 

If the child or youth cannot take all their belongings with them, **do both of these things**:

* Make a plan with the caseworker to return the belongings to them as soon as possible. 
* Keep their belongings safe for at least 30 days after the child or youth leaves your home. If 30 days pass and the child or youth still does not have all their belongings, talk to the caseworker about what to do. 

If you bought things for your home or for children or youth to share, you can keep these things when the child or youth leaves. When you give the child or youth a gift, it helps to be clear about what belongs to them, and what belongs to the family or the household. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
You do not need to hold onto belongings that the child or youth has outgrown or that are no longer usable. For example, if the child or youth outgrows a piece of clothing or a toy breaks during placement, we do not expect you to hold onto those things, unless they’re important to the child or youth. If you have questions about the importance of a specific item, ask the caseworker. 

If you want recommendations for where to donate things, ask your [local CaRES mentors](https://alliancecares.org/).
