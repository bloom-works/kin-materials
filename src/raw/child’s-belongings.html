Always treat your child’s belongings with care and respect. Examples of your child’s belongings include: 

* Clothing
* Mementos
* Bicycles
* Gifts
* Money

“When handling and storing children's and youth's personal belongings, caregivers must… Verify children or youth who leave their home and take their personal belongings with them. This includes belongings they brought with them and those acquired while in care.”

### If your child leaves your home

If the child leaves your home to live somewhere else, store their belongings safely for at least 30 days after they leave. 

If the child cannot take their belongings with them, make a plan with the child’s caseworker to return the belongings to the child as soon as possible. \
