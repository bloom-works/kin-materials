To be a foster parent, you need a license from the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).

To get your license, you can either work directly with DCYF’s Licensing Division or work with a Child Placing Agency (CPA) or a Tribal CPA.

## **How to choose a licensing agency**

The different licensing agencies each have their own benefits. You can choose whichever option is a better fit for your needs and preferences.

### 

**Benefits of CPAs** 

Licensed CPAs work with the state child welfare system. They are responsible for completing home studies and certifying foster parents. Tribes may have their own CPAs. Other CPAs have their own specialties, such as supporting children and youth with greater behavioral needs or who come from  a specific religion.

If you work with a CPA, the CPA decides which children and youth are a good fit for your home. This means that they screen out placements that they do not think will work for you. They also provide training and ongoing support after children and youth are placed with you. 

A CPA can be a good choice if you:

* Are new to fostering
* Want more support with your placements
* Want to work with an agency that reflects your culture or supports children with specific needs 



### **Benefits of DCYF’s Licensing Division**

When you get licensed through DCYF’s Licensing Division, you work directly with licensing workers and caseworkers. Instead of having your placements screened by a CPA, you discuss potential placements with DCYF and decide for yourself which children and youth are a good fit for your home. 

DCYF’s Licensing Division can be a good choice if you:

* Prefer to communicate directly with DCYF staff and choose your own placements
* Are comfortable with self-advocacy and working with large systems
* Are open to supporting a wide variety of children and youth, as opposed to those with specific needs or backgrounds 

## **How to get licensed through a Child Placing Agency (CPA) or a Tribal CPA**

A CPA can certify that you meet the requirements to become a foster parent. When a CPA certifies you, your license still comes from DCYF.

If you get certified through a CPA, they might have a few additional guidelines to help you get and keep your license. They will also provide support and coordinate services for children or youth who are in your care.

If a CPA decides not to certify you and you want to challenge that decision, you have to follow the CPA’s grievance process. If you get certified through a CPA, DCYF still makes the final decision to approve your license.

### **Handling conflicts of interest**

You cannot get licensed by a specific CPA if you or someone in your household has a financial interest in that CPA or works there in one of these roles:

* Administration
* Supervision
* Foster home certification
* Placement
* Payment authorization
* Case management

You can still get licensed by a different CPA.

If you get certified by a CPA and then start working, volunteering, or interning at that CPA in any of those roles, you have to do **one** of the following within six months of starting to work with the CPA:

* Get recertified by a different CPA 
* Get licensed directly by DCYF

## **How to get licensed through DCYF’s Licensing Division**

To get licensed through DCYF’s Licensing Division, you have two options:

* Fill out the [Foster Parent Inquiry form](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/questionnaire) and the recruitment team will email you within two business days.
* Call 1-888-KIDS-414.

If you or any of your relatives work for DCYF, you have to follow DCYF’s departmental policies for getting licensed. If you have questions about these policies, ask your supervisor or the Human Resources department.
