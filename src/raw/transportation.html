It’s your responsibility to get the child or youth in your care to their appointments and activities safely.

Have a plan to get them to their appointments and activities. This plan must be appropriate for their age, development, and specific needs. You do not need to own a vehicle. If you do not drive, you do not need to have a driver’s license. 

Anyone who drives the child or youth in a private vehicle must:

* Always follow [state traffic laws](https://dol.wa.gov/driver-licenses-and-permits/driver-training-and-testing/driver-guides/washington-state-driver-guide-text-only), including speed limits and stop signs.
* Use the right safety equipment for the child based on their age, and their specific needs. This includes car seats or booster seats.

Learn how to [get paid back for gas mileage or transportation costs](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/resources/payments) for approved activities.

There are transportation services available to and from [family time](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/visitation-family-time), and [school](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/education). If the child or youth needs other transportation help, ask the caseworker about other services that may be available.
