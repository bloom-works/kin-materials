It’s your responsibility to get your child to their appointments and activities safely. 

Have a plan to get your child to their appointments and activities. This plan must be appropriate for your child’s age, development, and specific needs.

When you’re driving the child in your own vehicle, you must:

* Always follow state traffic laws, including speed limits and stop signs.
* Use the right safety equipment for the child based on their age, and their specific needs. This includes car seats or booster seats.
