It’s your responsibility to get the child or youth in your care to their appointments and activities safely.

Have a plan to get them to their appointments and activities. This plan must be appropriate for their age, development, and specific needs.

The driver of any private vehicle the child or youth rides in must:

* Always follow state traffic laws, including speed limits and stop signs.
* Use the right safety equipment for the child based on their age, and their specific needs. This includes car seats or booster seats.

Learn how to [get paid back for gas mileage or transportation costs](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments-get-paid-back) for approved activities.
