Before or shortly after a child or youth comes to live with you, DCYF completes a home study. A home study is the process we use to get to know you, and help you prepare to meet the child or youth’s needs.

### Caregiver questions

We'll talk with you to learn about you and your family, your plan to care for the child or youth, and how we offer support.

Our goal is to make sure you have the support and resources to meet the child or youth’s needs.

We’ll discuss these topics: 

* The people in your household.
* Your relationship with the child or youth and their parents.
* How the placement of the child or youth will change your life.
* Your plan to meet the child or youth’s health, education, and cultural or religious needs.  
* How your physical and mental health, substance use, and relationships may affect your ability to care for the child or youth.
* Guiding child or youth behavior including [positive discipline](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/discipline-and-restraint/).
* [Resources you have, or will need](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments), to support the child or youth.

### Physical safety questions

We’ll review the physical environment of your home. We’ll identify safety improvements to make or items to get, to meet the child or youth’s needs.
