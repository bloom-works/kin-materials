Before we place a child or youth in your home, we need to get to know you, and help prepare you and your family to meet the child or youth’s needs. This is called the home study process. 

### Caregiver discussion questions

We’ll ask you questions to understand your and your family’s ability to care for a child or youth. We’ll also identify additional ways we can support you. Our goal is to make sure you have the support and resources to meet the child or youth’s needs.  

We’ll discuss these topics: 

* The people in your household 
* Your relationship with the child or youth, and their parents 
* How the placement of the child or youth may change your home life 
* Your ability to support child care, health, education, and any cultural or religious practices that matter to the child or youth or legal parents
* Your physical and mental health, and history of substance use
* How to manage a child or youth’s behavior
* Resources you have, or will need to support the child or youth, like financial help and child care

### Physical safety questions

We’ll review the physical environment of your home. We’ll identify safety improvements to make or items to get, to meet the child or youth’s needs. 

We can help you make safety improvements. We can also help you buy physical items to make your home safe.  

We’ll discuss these home and safety topics: 

* Health and medicine
* Weapons 
* Drugs and alcohol 
* Transportation
* Home conditions, including: 

  * Basic home safety 
  * Outdoor spaces 
  * Sleeping spaces
  * Toxic substances 
  * Emergency preparedness
