There may be times when you need to correct the behavior of the child or youth in your care. It can feel challenging to know how to discipline them in a safe and effective way. Follow these rules to ensure a healthy approach to discipline.

### Appropriate forms of discipline

When disciplining the child or youth, keep their age and level of development in mind. 

A child or youth in care has experienced difficult events or situations, and trauma. This can affect their development. It may not align with what you might expect for someone their age. You may need to adjust your expectations for the child or youth’s abilities.  

There is training available to support you. For example, you can ask for [training on how to use positive methods of guidance](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses/content/parenting-positive-discipline-way) to encourage the child or youth to develop self-control, self-responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and cooperation. 

When using positive methods of guidance, you may want to:

* Direct the child or youth to another activity
* Practice “time-ins,” giving the child or youth time to change their behavior
* Plan to prevent problems
* Reinforce positive behaviors
* Encourage the child or youth to express their feelings and ideas
* Give the child or youth choices

You may have questions about other methods of discipline or consequences not listed here (such as timeouts or taking toys away), and whether they’re appropriate for the child or youth. Talk to the caseworker. They can give you more information, and guide you towards resources or support.

### Inappropriate forms of discipline

Do not use physical punishment, verbal abuse, or neglectful, humiliating, degrading, or frightening punishment.

This means: 

* Do not hit the child or youth.
* Do not spank them.
* Do not restrict their breathing.
* Do not punish them by forcing them to exercise or physically exert themselves.
* Do not call them names.
* Do not use demeaning language towards them (for example, do not call them stupid or dumb). 
* Do not threaten or intimidate them.
* Do not trap or restrict them in any space. For example, do not lock them in a bedroom, basement, closet, or shed, or remove a doorknob so they cannot get out.
* Do not withhold food, water, or other basic needs.
* Do not interfere with their cultural needs. For example, do not cut an Indian child's or youth's hair, or take a religious or cultural item or event away from them.
* Do not limit or cut off their family connections. For example, don’t take away meaningful items, gifts from their parents, or time spent with their family.

### Physical restraint

#### When is it acceptable to use physical restraint? 

It’s almost never okay to physically restrain a child or youth.

The only time it may be okay to physically restrain them is if the child or youth, another person, or an animal is in immediate danger, or to prevent serious property damage. 

If you have to physically restrain the child or youth, you must do it in a way that’s appropriate for the situation. [](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/what-do-i-have-to-report/)

If the child or youth shows behaviors you are not sure how to handle, talk to the caseworker. 

#### When do I need to report physical restraint? 

Report these to the caseworker: 

* **Every incident of physical restraint**. Report each incident to the caseworker **within 24 hours of the incident**, preferably as soon as possible. 
* **When you have to physically restrain the child or youth multiple times**. Talk to the caseworker and develop a plan for how to handle these situations. 

You may need to complete training about how and when to use safe physical restraint that’s based on the specific needs of the child or youth.
