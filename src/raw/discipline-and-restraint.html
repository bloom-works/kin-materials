There may be times when you need to discipline your child. It can feel challenging to know how to discipline your child in a way that’s safe and effective. Follow these rules to ensure a healthy approach to discipline.

### Appropriate forms of discipline

When disciplining your child, keep the child’s age and level of development in mind. Techniques for disciplining your child should be appropriate for their age and level of development.

You can request training on how to use positive methods of guidance to encourage your child to develop self-control, self-responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and cooperation. 

When using positive methods of guidance, you may want to:

* Direct the child to another activity
* Give the child choices when appropriate
* Practice “time-ins,” giving the child time to change their behavior
* Plan to prevent problems
* Reinforce positive behaviors
* Encourage the child to express their feelings and ideas

### Inappropriate forms of discipline

Do not use physical or verbal abuse to punish your child. This means: 

* Do not hit the child.
* Do not spank the child.
* Do not restrict the child’s breathing.
* Do not call the child names.
* Do not threaten or intimidate the child.
* Do not trap the child in a confined space.
* Do not punish the child with exercise or other physical activity.

Do not use neglect, humiliation, degradation, or fear to punish your child. This means:

* Do not withhold food, water, or other basic needs from the child.
* Do not interfere with the child’s cultural needs. For example, do not cut an Indian child's or youth's hair, or take a religious or cultural item or event away from your child.
* Do not limit or cut off their family connections. For example, don’t take away meaningful items, gifts from their parents, or time spent with their family.

### Physical restraint

Physically restraining a child is not an appropriate response in most situations. 

The only times it may be acceptable to physically restrain your child are when your child, another person, or an animal is in immediate danger, or to prevent serious property damage. 

If you need to physically restrain your child, you must do it in a way that’s appropriate for the situation. 

If you physically restrain your child, take these steps after the incident: 

* Notify their caseworker within 24 hours of the incident, preferably as soon as possible
* If you find yourself physically restraining your child multiple times, consult with the child’s caseworkers and develop a plan for how to handle these situations
* You may need to complete training about how and when to use physical restraint that is based on the specific needs of the child or youth.
