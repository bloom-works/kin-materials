If you know or suspect that your relative or friend’s child is in foster care, and you want to step forward to care for them, contact the family's caseworker.

* **If you know your relative or friend's child is experiencing foster care,** ask them for the caseworker's name and contact the caseworker. If you do not have the caseworker's contact details, you can look them up in the DCYF employee directory.
* **If you aren’t sure whether a relative or friend's child is experiencing foster care,** please be aware that DCYF can neither confirm nor deny that a child is in care. One way to bridge this challenge is to call the local child welfare office that serves the area in which the family lives. When DCYF staff answer the phone, tell them you’re calling because you believe your relative or friend's child entered care and you would like to speak with the caseworker. While the receptionist cannot tell you if the child or youth is in care, they can get you to a caseworker or supervisor who can. 

### If the child or youth lives outside of Washington state 

You may be concerned about a relative or friend’s child who lives outside of Washington State. The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) is an agreement that governs the placement of children from one state into another state.

### If you got a relative search letter

If you have questions about a Relative Search Inquiry letter or want to confirm the authenticity of a relative search letter you received from DCYF, [email one of the staff listed on this page.](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/relative-search)

We’ll continue to search for relatives throughout the duration of a case until the child or youth is in a permanent, stable living situation.
