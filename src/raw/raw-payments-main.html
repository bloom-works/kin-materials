You have several options for financial support in your role as a caregiver. Learn about payment options based on your caregiver licensing status.

## Unlicensed caregivers only

### Financial support for rent, utilities, gas, and groceries

DCYF may provide unlicensed caregivers financial support for rent, utilities, gas, or groceries. This support is only available short-term to help you get started. Once you become licensed, you’re no longer eligible for this support. 

Ask the caseworker for help covering these costs. 

### Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)

TANF is a federal program administered by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). It provides cash assistance and services to low-income families.

As a caregiver, you may be eligible for [non-needy relative TANF](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/esa/community-services-offices/non-needy-relative-loco-parentis-and-legal-guardian-grant) regardless of your income status. Learn more about [eligibility and how to get payments](./payments-tanf.html).

## Unlicensed and licensed caregivers

### Clothing vouchers

DCYF may provide clothing vouchers for the child or youth. Ask the caseworker about these vouchers.

### Diapers

Many community-based organizations (CBOs) offer diapers for caregivers with babies. You may get up to 10 diapers at a time. Ask the caseworker for a list of CBOs offering diapers.

### Other items and services

DCYF may be able to provide items and services to make your home safe for the child or youth, and help you support the child or youth’s wellbeing. 

For example, DCYF may be able to provide baby or personal care items when a child or youth first comes to live with you. 

Talk to the caseworker if you need help with any of these: 

* Safety items
* Baby items
* School supplies and tutoring
* Personal care items 
* Activities for family time
* Cleaning and storage
* Housing and furniture
* Cell phones
* Transportation and car repairs

### Mileage or transportation reimbursement

DCYF reimburses mileage or transportation costs for licensed and unlicensed caregivers. Learn more about [eligibility and how to get payments](./payments-get-paid-back.html).

### Property damage and emergency medical care reimbursement

DYCF provides limited reimbursement for property damage and emergency medical care caused by a child. Learn more about [eligibility and how to get payments](./payments-get-paid-back.html).

### Medical and dental coverage

If you are a caregiver for a state-dependent child, they will get medical and dental coverage through Apple Health. Apple Health is Washington’s Medicaid program. 

Visit [Apple Health](https://www.hca.wa.gov/about-hca/programs-and-initiatives/apple-health-medicaid) to learn more.

### Food and nutritional support

The Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program offers healthy foods and nutritional support. If you have an infant or child under 5 years old, you may be eligible for WIC. 

Visit the [Washington State WIC page](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/wic) or call the WIC Cascades Support Line at 1-800-841-1410 to learn how to apply.

### Paid family and medical leave

You may be eligible for the Washington Paid Family & Medical Leave. 

[Learn more about eligibility and how to apply](https://paidleave.wa.gov/app/uploads/2021/06/Parents-guide-V.5-FINAL.pdf)

If you work for DCYF or another Washington state agency, you may be able to get paid leave through a program for state employees. The Foster Parent Shared Leave Pool program allows state employees to donate paid leave to other state employees who are caring for a foster child or youth, or are preparing to care for one in their home.
