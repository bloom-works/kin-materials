You have several options for financial support in your role as a caregiver. Learn about payment options based on your caregiver licensing status.

If you're interested in other types of support and resources, learn more about [training and services](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/training-services). 

### Unlicensed caregivers only

#### Financial support for rent, utilities, gas, and groceries

DCYF may provide unlicensed caregivers financial support for rent, utilities, gas, or groceries. This support is only available short-term to help you get started. Once you become licensed, you’re no longer eligible for this support. 

Ask the caseworker for help covering these costs. 

#### Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)

TANF is a federal program administered by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). It provides cash assistance and services to low-income families.

As a caregiver, you may be eligible for [non-needy relative TANF](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/esa/community-services-offices/non-needy-relative-loco-parentis-and-legal-guardian-grant) regardless of your income status. Learn more about [eligibility and how to get payments](./payments-tanf.html).

### Unlicensed and licensed caregivers

#### Clothing vouchers

DCYF may provide clothing vouchers for your child. Ask the caseworker about these vouchers.

#### Diapers

Many community-based organizations (CBOs) offer diapers for caregivers with babies. You may get up to 10 diapers at a time. Ask the caseworker for a list of CBOs offering diapers.

#### Mileage or transportation reimbursement

DCYF reimburses mileage or transportation costs for licensed and unlicensed caregivers. Learn more about [eligibility and how to get payments](./payments-get-paid-back.html).

#### Property damage and emergency medical care reimbursement

DYCF provides limited reimbursement for property damage and emergency medical care caused by a child. Learn more about [eligibility and how to get payments](./payments-get-paid-back.html).

#### Medical and dental coverage

If you are a caregiver for a state-dependent child, they will get medical and dental coverage through Apple Health. Apple Health is Washington’s Medicaid program. 

Visit [Apple Health](https://www.hca.wa.gov/about-hca/programs-and-initiatives/apple-health-medicaid) to learn more.

#### Food and nutritional support

The Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program offers healthy foods and nutritional support. If you have an infant or child under 5 years old, you may be eligible for WIC. 

Visit the [Washington State WIC page](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/wic) or call the WIC Cascades Support Line at 1-800-841-1410 to learn how to apply.

### Licensed caregivers only

#### Foster care payments

As a licensed caregiver, you can get monthly foster care payments to reimburse you for food, clothing, shelter, and other caregiving expenses.
