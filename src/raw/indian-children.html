If you are caring for a child or youth who is connected to a Tribe, you need to help them maintain their culture and their familial and ancestral ties. 

### Tribal connections

It is important for the child or youth to connect with their tribe and tribal communities. 

Provide opportunities for them to: 

* Attend and participate in cultural and spiritual ceremonies, events and activities.
* Learn tribal stories and songs.

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}Talk to the child or youth’s caseworker or family to learn about cultural traditions. 

Explore the tribe's website to learn about tribal traditions, stories, traditional language, and songs.{% endCallout %}

### Working with the child or youth’s caseworker

Your child or youth’s caseworker is here to support you. Work with them to:

* Support the child or youth’s connections to their Tribe, Tribal families, extended families, and communities.
* Repair, replace, or provide culturally significant items.
* Develop a case plan that includes instructions for, but not limited to:

  * Following recommendations from the local Indian child welfare advisory committee.
  * Managing payments from a Tribe. These payments include per capita, general welfare, and settlement funds.
  * Supporting and helping the child or youth attend cultural events and activities.
  * Other actions listed on this page.

### Health, medicine, and food

Work with the child or youth’s caseworker to create a case plan that includes having and using Native American traditional medicines. 

These medicines include, but are not limited to:

* Sage
* Cedar
* Sweet grass

Work with the caseworker to include providing plant-based or lactose free alternatives to cow's milk in the case plan.

Provide safe sleeping spaces. These include baby boards and moss bags.

### Discipline

Do not interfere with the child or youth’s cultural needs when you discipline them.

For example, do not cut their hair or take a religious or cultural item or event away from them.

### Travel

If the child or youth is in the care and custody of a tribal court, [consult with tribes](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/what-do-i-need-permission-for) before they travel out of the state or country.

Work with their caseworker to include this in their case plan.

### Changing the child or youth’s appearance

Changes that you need the caseworker’s permission for include:
