If you are caring for a child who is part of a tribe, you need to help them maintain their culture, and their familial and ancestral ties. 

### Tribal connections

It is important for your kin child to connect with their tribal families and communities. 

Provide opportunities for them to: 

* Attend cultural and spiritual events and ceremonies.
* Participate in cultural and spiritual other activities.
* Learn tribal stories and songs.

### Working with your child’s caseworker

Your kin child’s caseworker is here to support you. Work with them to: 

* Support your kin child’s connections to their tribal families and communities.
* Repair, replace, or provide culturally significant items. 
* Develop a case plan that includes instructions for, but not limited to:
* * Following recommendations from the local Indian child welfare advisory committee

  * Managing payments from a tribe. These payments include per capita, general welfare, and settlement funds.

  * Allowing your kin child to attend cultural events and activities

  * Other actions listed on this page

### Health, medicine, and food

Work with your kin child’s caseworker to create a case plan that includes having and using Native American traditional medicines. 

These medicines include, but are not limited to:

* Sage
* Cedar
* Sweet grass

Also work with the caseworker to include these in the case plan:  

* Using baby boards and moss bags
* Providing plant-based or lactose free alternatives to cow's milk, if your child is lactose intolerant

### Discipline

Do not interfere with your kin child’s cultural needs when you discipline them. 

For example, do not cut their hair or take a religious or cultural item or event away from them.

### Travel

If your kin child is in the care and custody of a tribal court, consult with tribes before they travel out of the state or country. 

Work with your kin child’s caseworker to include this in their case plan. 

### Changing your kin child’s appearance

Get permission from your kin child’s caseworker before you make changes to their appearance. 

Changes that you need the caseworker’s permission for include: 

* Haircuts
* Changes to the color of your child’s hair 
* Piercings
* Tattoos
