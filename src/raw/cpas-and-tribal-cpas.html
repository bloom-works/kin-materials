You can apply for a kinship caregiver license through DCYF, or a child-placing agency (CPA) or a tribal CPA. 

If you apply through a CPA, the CPA will decide whether to certify you.  

CPAs may have other requirements to get or maintain a license. Any other requirements will be directly related to the child or youth’s needs or case plans. 

If you do not agree with a CPA’s decision on your application, you must follow the CPA’s appeals process to challenge the decision.
