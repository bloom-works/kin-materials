You can apply for a kinship license through either:

* DCYF
* A Child Placing Agency (CPA) or a tribal CPA

### What is a CPA?

A CPA is a private agency that does home studies, certifies families to get kinship licenses from DCYF, and makes updates when you have changes in your home or household. A CPA can be a good choice if you want more ongoing support, or an agency that reflects your culture, or supports the child or youth’s specific needs. 

CPAs have their own specialties. Examples of specialties include: 

* Working with children or youth who are connected to a tribe 
* Supporting children and youth with greater behavioral needs 
* Reflecting specific values or being affiliated with certain religions

If you decide to work with a CPA, you'll work directly with CPA staff to get licensed. The CPA will also provide support and coordinate services for the child or youth, or your family. 
  .  

### How to work with a CPA

You can decide to work with a CPA at any time, even after you get a license. Or if you work with a CPA, you can switch to working with DCYF directly. Tell your licensing worker you want to switch, or ask them how to apply with the agency you want to transfer to. You’ll need to complete paperwork and an updated home study. 

If you apply for a license through a CPA and you disagree with an agency’s decision on your application, you must follow the agency’s appeals process to challenge the decision.
