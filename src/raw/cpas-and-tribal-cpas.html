You can apply for a kinship license through:

* DCYF
* A child-placing agency (CPA) or a tribal CPA

If you apply through a CPA, the CPA will decide whether to certify you.  

CPAs and tribal CPAs may have other requirements you need to meet. Any other requirements will be directly related to the child or youth’s needs or case plans. 

If you do not agree with an agency’s decision on your application, you must follow the agency’s appeals process to challenge the decision.
