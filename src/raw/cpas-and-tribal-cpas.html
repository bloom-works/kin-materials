You can apply for a kinship caregiver license through:

* DCYF
* A child-placing agency (CPA)
* A tribal CPA

If you apply through a CPA, the CPA will decide whether to certify you.  

CPAs may have other requirements you need to meet. Any other requirements will be directly related to the child or youth’s needs or case plans. 

If you do not agree with a CPA’s decision on your application, you must follow the CPA’s appeals process to challenge the decision.
