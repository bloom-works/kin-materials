We highly encourage kinship caregivers to become licensed. There is one type of long-term license for all kinship caregivers. If you plan to apply for a kinship caregiver license, but do not have one yet, you may be able to get a short-term license. 

### Kinship caregiver license

A kinship caregiver license gives you additional support, including monthly payments to cover the costs of caring for a child or youth (these are called [monthly foster care maintenance payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments)). 

A license lasts for 3 years. You must renew your license before it expires. 

There are specific [requirements](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/) for getting a kinship caregiver license. 

### Short-term licenses

If you’re planning to apply for a kinship caregiver license, but you don’t have a license yet, you can apply for one of these types of short-term licenses: 

* Initial license 
* Provisional expedited license 

#### Initial license

An initial license is a 90-day license that allows you to get foster care maintenance payments while you care for a child or youth, apply for a full license, and go through the home study process. 

This type of license lasts for 90 days. If 90 days pass and you still do not have your full license, we’ll stop your foster care maintenance payments. We’ll continue the payments only when you have a full kinship caregiver license. 

If we issue you an initial license, and you later accept the placement of other children or youth, we can reissue your initial license to include the other children or youth. 

There are specific [requirements](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/) for getting an initial license. 

#### Provisional expedited license

A provisional expedited license is a temporary license that we may issue while you go through the approval process for a full license.

It allows you to get foster care maintenance payments while you care for a child or youth, apply for a full license, and go through the home study process. 

If you apply for a provisional expedited license, we’ll also complete the home study process and make a decision about your full license within 90 calendar days. 

There are specific [requirements](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/) for getting a provisional expedited license.
