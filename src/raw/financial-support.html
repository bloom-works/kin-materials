We understand that the costs of caring for a child or youth can be overwhelming. There are several options for financial support that may be available to you. 

## For licensed foster parents and licensed kinship caregivers only 

The main source of financial support for caregivers is [monthly foster care payments](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/roles-responsibilities/payments/foster-care-payments). These payments may cover the costs of food, clothing, shelter, and other caregiving expenses. 

These payments are available to licensed foster parents and licensed kinship caregivers only.

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
If you’re considering becoming a kinship caregiver, or you’re already an unlicensed kinship caregiver with DCYF, we encourage you to opt in to a license so you can get monthly foster care payments. You're eligible to get a license after you complete background checks and the home study process.

## For licensed foster parents and all kinship caregivers 

There are some options for financial support for caregivers, regardless of whether you’re a licensed or unlicensed caregiver. These include transportation reimbursement from DCYF, and other types of help from community organizations and Washington state.
