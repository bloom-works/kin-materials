You must keep the child or youth in your care away from drugs and alcohol in your home.

### Access to drugs and alcohol

Keep these substances stored away where the child or youth cannot access them:

* Alcohol
* Marijuana
* Nicotine products, including cigarettes, cigars, vapes, nicotine pouches, and chewing tobacco 
* Other drugs and paraphernalia

If you have any safety concerns about how to keep drugs or alcohol stored away from the child or youth, talk to your licensor. We can support you and can give you a lock if you need one.

### Personal use of drugs and alcohol

Do not use drugs or alcohol in a way that affects your ability to safely care for the child or youth. It does not matter if the substance is legal.
