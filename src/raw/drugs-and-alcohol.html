You must keep your child safe from drugs and alcohol. 

### Access to drugs and alcohol

Keep these substances stored away where your child cannot access them: 

* Alcohol
* Marijuana
* Nicotine products, including cigarettes, cigars, vapes, nicotine pouches, and chewing tobacco

DCYF can give you a lock if you need one.

### Personal use of drugs and alcohol 

Do not use drugs or alcohol in a way that affects your ability to care for your child. It does not matter if the substance is legal.
