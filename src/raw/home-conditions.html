A clean and safe home is essential to your child’s wellbeing. You must take proper care and precautions to provide a clean and safe home.

### Basic home safety

Make reasonable efforts to make sure your home has the following: 

* Heating and cooling
* Access to electricity and lighting
* Safe drinking water
* Toilet and bathing facilities

If there are pets in your home, make sure they’re clean and safe for your child. 

Fix any home safety hazards. Examples include: 

* Pest infestation
* Fire hazards (exposed wires or flammable materials cannot be within three feet of a fire source)
* Overflowing garbage
* Uncontained pet waste
* Excessive debris

If you have trouble meeting these conditions, we will try to get you items you need to make your home clean and safe.

### Outdoor spaces

Check that outdoor spaces are safe for your child. Supervise your child in outdoor spaces, especially around:

* Trampolines
* Bodies of water
* Pools
* Hot tubs 
* Fire pits

### Sleeping spaces

#### For babies under 12 months old

If your child is a baby under 12 months old, provide them with a sleeping space that meets infant sleep safety requirements.

Examples of sleeping spaces include: 

* Bassinets
* Native American cradle boards and moss bags
* Cribs
* Portable cribs 

The sleeping space must: 

* Have a firm, flat sleep surface (not at an angle or inclined)
* Be empty except for a fitted sheet
* Not include soft bedding (blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or stuffed toys)

All cribs must comply with [Washington state laws](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.111) and federal consumer safety standards for [full-size cribs](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1219) and [non-full-size cribs](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1220).[](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1220)[](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1220)

#### For children and youth over 12 months old

If your child or youth is over 12 months old, provide them with their own safe sleeping space with bedding. Any exceptions must be approved by the child’s caseworker.

### Toxic substances

If there’s a risk that your child may mishandle toxic substances around the home, keep them stored away where your child can’t access them. Examples include: 

* Cleaning products
* Mechanical fluids, like motor oil or antifreeze

### Emergency preparedness

Work with your licensing worker to get your home ready in case of emergencies and to create a safety plan.

Make sure your home has the following:

* Working smoke detectors inside and outside of all sleeping areas, on each story, in all play areas, and in the basement of the home.
* A working carbon monoxide detector on each level of the home.
* Access to a working fire extinguisher. We recommend a 2A10BC-rated fire extinguisher that is five pounds or bigger.
* An unblocked exit to the outside from each child's or youth's sleeping space that is big enough for emergency personnel wearing rescue gear to access, unless a supervision plan is approved by the licensing division’s administrator.

You’ll also need to make sure that:

* You have a reliable way to contact emergency services when your child is home
* Your child can escape from every floor in the home
* You create an evacuation plan with your child in case of fires, natural disasters, or other emergencies.
