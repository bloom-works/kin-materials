A clean and safe home is essential to your child’s wellbeing. 

### Basic home safety

Make reasonable efforts to make sure your home has the following: 

* Heating and cooling
* Access to electricity and lighting
* Safe drinking water
* Toilet and bathing facilities

If there are pets in your home, make sure they’re clean, and safe for your child. 

Fix any home safety hazards. Examples include: 

* Pest infestation
* Fire hazards. Exposed wires or flammable materials cannot be within three feet of a fire source
* Overflowing garbage
* Uncontained pet waste
* Excessive debris

If you have trouble meeting these conditions, we will try to get you items you need to make your home safe and sanitary. 

### Outdoor spaces

Check that outdoor spaces are safe for your child. Supervise your child in outdoor spaces, especially around:

* Trampolines
* Bodies of water
* Pools
* Hot tubs 
* Fire pits

### Sleeping spaces

#### For babies under 12 months old

If your child is a baby under 12 months old, provide them with a sleeping space that meets infant safe sleep requirements. 

The sleeping space must have a firm, flat sleep surface (not at an angle or inclined). Keep the sleeping space empty except for a fitted sheet. Do not keep soft bedding (blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or stuffed toys) in the sleeping space. 

Examples of sleeping spaces include: 

* Bassinets
* Native American cradle boards and moss bags
* Cribs
* Portable cribs 

All cribs must comply with federal consumer safety standards, and Washington state laws:

* [Washington state law Chapter 70.111 RCW](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.111)
* [Federal safety standards for full-size cribs (16 C.F.R. 1219)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1219)
* [Federal safety standards for non-full-size cribs (16 C.F.R. 1220)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1220)[](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1220)

#### For children and youth over 12 months old

If your child or youth is over 12 months old, provide them with their own safe sleeping space with bedding. Any exceptions must be approved by the child’s caseworker.

### Toxic substances

If there’s a risk that your child may mishandle toxic substances around the home, keep them stored away where your child can’t access them. Examples include: 

* Cleaning products
* Mechanical fluids, like motor oil or antifreeze

### Emergency preparedness

Work with your licensor to get your home ready in case of emergencies. 

Have a reliable way to contact emergency services when your child is home. 

Check that your child can escape from every floor in the home. 

Create an evacuation plan with your child in case of fires, natural disasters, or other emergencies.

Make sure your home has the following:

* Working smoke detectors inside and outside of all sleeping areas, on each story, in all play areas, and in the basement of the home.
* A working carbon monoxide detector on each level of the home.
* Access to a working fire extinguisher. We recommend a 2A10BC-rated fire extinguisher that is five pounds or bigger.
* An unblocked exit to the outside from each child's or youth's sleeping space that is big enough for emergency personnel wearing rescue gear to access, unless a supervision plan is approved by the licensing division’s administrator.
