You must provide care that respects your kin child’s race, religion, and culture. 

This includes:

* Creating a supportive environment for them at home and in your community
* Providing opportunities to take part in spiritual, religious, or tribal activities as needed
* Sharing relevant resources with them so they can get more support.  

Creating a supportive environment could include:

* Providing books, media, and toys that reflect your kin child’s background
* Including language, food, and traditions from their culture in everyday life

You will need to adjust your care based on your kin child's emotional and developmental needs.
