Provide care that respects your child’s race, religion, and culture. Your care should be appropriate for your child based on their emotional and developmental needs. 

Create a supportive and affirming environment for your child at home and in your community. For example, affirm their racial and cultural identity. You can do this by offering your child books, media, and toys that reflect their background, and including language, food, and traditions from their culture in everyday life.

Give your child opportunities to participate or not participate in spiritual or religious activities. 

If your child belongs to a tribe, give your child opportunities to participate in tribal activities within their community or extended family.

Share relevant resources with them so they can get more support.
