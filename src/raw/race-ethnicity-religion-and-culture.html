You must provide care that respects and supports the race, ethnicity, religion, and culture of the child or youth in your care. 

This includes:

* Providing books, media, and toys that reflect their background.
* Including language, food, and traditions from their culture in everyday life.
* Giving them opportunities to participate in spiritual, religious, or tribal activities. This includes bringing the child or youth to these activities, and observing cultural holidays.
* Sharing support resources that the child or youth can explore on their own.


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
**Note:** If the child or youth’s religious choices conflict with their parents’, let the caseworker know.
{% endCallout %}

Consider learning about how to support the child or youth’s racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural identities. For example, you can: 

* Read, watch, or listen to materials on how to support children or youth’s identities.
* Go to [trainings, workshops, or classes](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses/courses) about how to support children or youth’s identities.
* Meet other caregivers or families who care for children or youth of different racial or ethnic identities.
