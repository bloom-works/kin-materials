As a licensed caregiver, you can get monthly foster care payments. Find out how much you can get to support the child in your care.

{% Callout "note" %}In January 2024, DCYF updated its caregiver payment levels. [Learn more about why we made these changes](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project/phase-one). {% endCallout %}

### Levels of caregiver support 

Your monthly payment amount depends on the level or type of caregiver support your child needs.

Here are the different **levels** of caregiver support:

* **Level 1 (Basic care):** You’re caring for a child or youth who’s developing similarly to children or youth their age.  

* **Level 2:** You’re caring for a child or youth who needs more support from you because they’re 12 years old or older. The payment is based on the needs of the youth, who’s developing similarly to youth their age.   

* **Level 3:** You’re caring for a child or youth who’s diagnosed with at least 1 chronic medical condition. They need more support from you because of their medical needs.

* **Level 4:** You’re caring for a child or youth who’s diagnosed with a developmental disability. They need more support from you because of their medical and behavioral needs.

* **Level 5:** You’re caring for a child or youth who’s diagnosed with a developmental disability and has at least 1 chronic health condition.  

* **Level 6:** You’re caring for a child or youth who currently has a mental health diagnosis or is taking prescription medication to help with their diagnosis.   

* **Level 7:** You’re caring for a child or youth who has complex mental health needs and needs more support to help stabilize and keep them safe.

### Monthly caregiver payment amount

You can get basic foster care payments (**Level 1**) to help you pay for food, clothing, shelter, and other caregiving expenses. **Levels 2 to 7** are supplemental or extra payments you can get if you care for a child who has a medical condition or disability, or needs mental health support.
