As a licensed caregiver, you can get monthly foster care payments. Find out how much money you'll receive to support the child in your care.

{% Callout "note", "undefined" %}In January 2024, DCYF updated its caregiver payment levels. [Learn more about why we made these changes](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project/phase-one). {% endCallout %}

### Levels of caregiver supports

Your monthly payment amount depends on the level or type of caregiver supports the child needs.

Here are the different **levels** of caregiver supports:

* **Level 1 (Basic care)**: The child does not have any identified health or behavioral needs.
* **Level 2**: The child or youth is age 12 or older with no identified health or behavioral needs.
* **Level 3**: The child or youth has a chronic health condition that may last at least a year.
* **Level 4**: The child or youth has a developmental disability.
* **Level 5**: The child or youth has both a chronic health condition and a developmental disability.
* **Level 6**: The child or youth has a mental health diagnosis or a prescription for a mental health condition within the past 15 months. 
* **Level 7**: The child or youth has attempted suicide or self-harm, requiring medical care in the past 15 months, or has received crisis mental health services during that time.

### Monthly caregiver payment amount

You can get basic foster care payments (**Level 1**) to reimburse you for food, clothing, shelter, and other caregiving costs. The payments are given monthly at a flat rate. They’re not an itemized reimbursement for individual caregiving costs.

**Levels 2 to 7** are supplemental or extra payments you can get if you care for a child who has physical, developmental, behavioral, or mental health needs.

Depending on the child’s age and level of caregiver supports, here’s your estimated monthly payment amount.
