Foster care maintenance payments help you cover the cost of:

* Food  
* Clothing  
* Shelter  
* Other caregiver expenses

#### Steps to get payment

Once you get licensed:

1. DCYF will send you an invoice each month   
2. You will need to submit or “claim” invoices every month   
3. DCYF will mail you a check or deposit payments into your bank account 

##### 1\. Get your invoice

Invoices include the number of nights that a child was in your care. You have 2 options for how to get invoices:

<ul class="icon-list">
{% IconListItem "mail"%}By mail{% endIconListItem %}

{% IconListItem "online" %}Electronically{% endIconListItem %}
</ul>

DCYF will mail you paper invoices unless you sign up to receive them electronically. 

###### Sign up for electronic invoices

To access invoices online, create an account on [Secure Access Washington (SAW)](https://secureaccess.wa.gov/myAccess/saw/select.do). In SAW, you can access the Social Services Payment System (SSPS) Provider Portal.

##### 2\. Claim your invoice

Check that the invoice dates match the dates each child was in your care. Count every night that a child slept in your home. Then claim the invoice to get your payment. You have 3 options for how to claim invoices: 

<ul class="icon-list">
{% IconListItem "phone" %}[By phone](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/documents/22-369.pdf) by calling 1-888-461-8855{% endIconListItem %}

{% IconListItem "online" %}Online through [the Provider Portal on your SAW account](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/ProviderPaymentsTraining.pdf){% endIconListItem %}

{% IconListItem "mail" %}By mail to State of Washington, SSPS, PO Box 45889, Olympia, WA 98584-5889. Fill and sign the invoice, and make a copy for your records before you mail it.{% endIconListItem %}
</ul>

{% Callout %}If the child left your home before the end of the month the invoice may be wrong. When invoices are printed they include estimated stays. You will need to correct it before claiming.{% endCallout %}

##### 3\. Get your reimbursement

You have 2 options for how to get funds: 

<ul class="icon-list">
{% IconListItem "mail" %}By mail{% endIconListItem %}

{% IconListItem "direct-deposit" %}By direct deposit{% endIconListItem %}
</ul>

DCYF will mail you a check unless you sign up for direct deposit. Using direct deposit is not required, but DCYF highly recommends it. You’ll receive your reimbursements faster through direct deposit.

###### Sign up for direct deposit

If you’d like your money deposited into your bank account, you can sign up for direct deposit. 

To sign up for direct deposit you must fill out 2 forms and submit them together: 

{% Download "pdf" %}[Provider registration form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/forms/ProviderRegistrationForm.pdf){% endDownload %} 
{% Download "pdf" %}[Direct deposit form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/forms/ProviderDirectDepositAuthorizationform.pdf){% endDownload %}

You have 2 options for signing the forms: 

<ul class="icon-list">
{% IconListItem "online" %}E-sign [forms](https://ofm.wa.gov/it-systems/accounting-systems/statewide-vendorpayee-services) using Docusign{% endIconListItem %}
{% IconListItem "pen" %}Print and sign, then email [forms](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/ProviderPaymentsTraining.pdf) to [ProviderFileUnit@dshs.wa.gov](mailto:ProviderFileUnit@dshs.wa.gov){% endIconListItem %}
</ul>

{% Callout %}It takes 4-6 weeks to process all the forms and complete the direct deposit process.{% endCallout %}
