If you do not meet the requirements to have a kinship caregiver license, you may still be able to get or continue a license by requesting an exemption.

We may approve your request if we find that you can provide for the safety, health, and wellbeing of your kinship child or youth.

If we deny your request for an exemption, you cannot appeal our decision.
