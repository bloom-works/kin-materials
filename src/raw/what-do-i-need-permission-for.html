### Certain recreational, social, and extracurricular activities

You need to get permission from the caseworker before the child or youth can do these activities: 

* **Recreational activities longer than 72 hours** (examples include, but are not limited to, family events, camping, sporting activities, and community events)
* **Social and extracurricular activities longer than 72 hours** (examples include, but are not limited to, field trips, faith-based activities, school activities, social activities with friends, spending the night away from your home)  

You also need to get permission from the caseworker before the youth can get a driver’s permit or license. 

If someone is visiting your home for longer than 72 hours, or on a regular basis, tell the caseworker. They may need to run a background check on the visitor. 

### Breaks from caregiving

If you need an occasional babysitter for less than 72 hours at a time, you do not need to get permission from the caseworker. Follow [prudent parenting standards](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/prudent-parenting) to choose a babysitter you trust to care for the child or youth. 

If you want to get [temporary care](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/taking-breaks) on a regular basis, or for more than 72 hours at a time, you’ll need to get approval from the caseworker. This is also called “respite care.”

[Learn more about respite care](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/taking-breaks). 

### Changes to the child or youth’s appearance 

Get permission from the caseworker before you make major changes to their appearance, even if their parents approve. Major changes to their appearance include, but are not limited to:

* All haircuts, including trims 
* Changes to the color of their hair 
* Piercings
* Tattoos (tattoos are not allowed for children or youth under age 18 in Washington state) 

### Travel for non-Indian children and youth

Get permission from the caseworker for:

* Travel out of state for more than 72 hours  
* Travel out of the U.S. for any length of time (you do not need permission to travel to the British Columbia areas of BC Rockies, Thompson/Okanogan, and Vancouver Coast and Mountains in Canada for less than 72 hours)

If you’re planning for the child or youth to travel out of state for less than 72 hours, you do not need permission. You have the power to make that decision using [prudent parenting standards](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/prudent-parenting). 

### Indian children and youth 

If the child or youth is in the custody of tribal court, you need to work with the tribal worker to make sure their medical care is culturally appropriate. Ask the caseworker for more information.

Get permission before the child or youth travels out of the state or country. If the child or youth lives on tribal land, get permission from the tribe that has jurisdiction. Otherwise, get permission from the child or youth’s tribe.
