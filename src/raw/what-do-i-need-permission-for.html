You need to get permission from the child or youth’s caseworker for certain activities.

### Ongoing or long-term respite

[Respite care](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/respite) is temporary care that allows you to take a break from parenting and caregiving. 

If you want respite care on a regular basis, or for more than 72 hours at a time, you’ll need to get approval from the child or youth’s caseworker.

### The child or youth’s appearance

Get permission from the child or youth's caseworker before you make major changes to their appearance including, but not limited to:

* Haircuts 
* Changes to the color of their hair 
* Piercings
* Tattoos (tattoos are not allowed for children or youth under age 18 in Washington state)

### Indian children 

If the child or youth is in the custody of Tribal court, you need to collaborate with the tribal worker to ensure culturally appropriate medical care. Ask their caseworker for more information.

Consult with the tribe before the child or youth travels out of the state or country.
