You need to get permission for certain aspects of the child or youth’s care. Follow the instructions on this page.

### The child or youth’s appearance 

Get permission from the child or youth's caseworker before you make major changes to the child’s appearance including, but not limited to:

* Haircuts 
* Changes to the color of their hair 
* Piercings
* Tattoos

### Indian children 

If the child or youth is in the custody of a tribal court, get permission from the tribe to consent for their medical care.

Consult with the tribe before the child or youth travels out of the state or country.
