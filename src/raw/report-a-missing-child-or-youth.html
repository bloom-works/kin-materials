If the child or youth is missing, you must follow the steps on this page to let us know. 

1. Notify all of these **as soon as you realize that the child or youth is missing (no more than 24 hours later)**: 

* Law enforcement or tribal law enforcement at 911, and 
* National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678, and
* The caseworker (or department intake at 1-866-363-4276 if you cannot contact the caseworker directly, or it’s after normal business hours)

Do not assume that DCYF already knows what happened, even if you’ve reported similar incidents in the past. You must report each incident when it happens.  

2. Provide law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children with: 

* A recent photo of the child or youth 
* A description of the child or youth, including their:

  * Height
  * Weight
  * Gender
  * Ethnicity
  * Race
  * Hair color 
  * Eye color 
* Any health or risk factors, including: 

  * If the child or youth is pregnant
  * Their prescription medications
  * If the child or youth has suicidal tendencies
  * If the child or youth is vulnerable to being sex trafficked 

3. If you find out where the child or youth is, or they return home, report this to the caseworker or department intake. DCYF will let law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children know.
