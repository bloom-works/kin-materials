If you’re a licensed kinship caregiver, you’ll get monthly foster care maintenance payments while caring for the child or youth. 

You can also talk to your child or youth’s caseworker about other financial support to help you meet the child or youth’s needs, regardless of whether you’re licensed or not. This support includes but is not limited to: 

* Money to cover the costs of gas, and transportation
* Money to cover the costs of property damage 
* Vouchers to buy clothes for the child or youth, if you cannot get what the child or youth needs with the monthly foster care maintenance payment, or through local community resources
