If you’re a licensed kinship caregiver, you’ll get monthly foster care maintenance payments while caring for the child or youth.

This support includes but is not limited to:

* Money to cover gas and transportation costs.
* Money to cover any property damage costs.
* Vouchers to buy clothes for the child or youth (if you cannot get what the child or youth needs with the monthly foster care maintenance payment or through local community resources).

You can also talk to the child or youth’s caseworker about other [financial support options](<>) to help you meet the child or youth’s needs whether you’re licensed or not.
