As of 2025, Washington has new rules to make it easier for kinship caregivers to become licensed. A license means you’re eligible for monthly foster care payments. If you decide to remain unlicensed, you will not get monthly foster care payments from DCYF. But, DCYF will still provide support and some financial help.

### Consider your options

- **Check if you are eligible for an Initial License.** If you have a voluntary placement agreement you are not eligible for the Initial License. You are eligible for a full license. 

- **Decide whether to get licensed**. Getting licensed is optional. You’ll be completing most of the steps to get licensed as part of placement, so DCYF encourages you to get licensed. 

- **Decide who to work with**. Only DCYF offers the Initial License. For the full Kinship License you can work with DCYF, a private child placing agency (CPA), or a Tribal CPA. A CPA can be a good choice if you want more ongoing support or an agency that reflects your culture. Learn about [CPA options](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147). {%- Callout -%}You can change agencies even after you get a license. You’ll need to complete paperwork and an updated home study.{%- endCallout %}

### Placement requirements

Whether you get licensed or not, you’ll need to meet several requirements so the child can remain in your care. These steps are also required for licensing, so a licensing worker may help you complete them. 

- **Get fingerprinted for background checks**. You and **each** member of your household age 18 and over need to be fingerprinted. Youth age 16 and over will need to be fingerprinted if they have lived out of state within the last 3 years. First, you’ll complete an online or paper form. Then, you’ll receive an email with instructions to set up appointments. You need to complete these within **10 days** of placement. {%- Callout -%}Washington DCYF is committed to keeping children with relatives or kin. They’ll work with you to understand background check results. In most cases, criminal records will not prevent licensing. Talk about your individual circumstances with your licensing worker. Learn about [crimes that may prevent DCYF from licensing you](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/secretaryslist.pdf).{%- endCallout %}

- **Complete and submit your application**. A licensing worker will help you complete your home study application online through Washington Caregiver Application Portal (WA CAP). {%- Callout -%}If you choose to get licensed and want more than one adult on the license, think about whose name you should list first. They’ll be the one receiving payments. A collector can take foster care payments if you have unresolved debts.{%- endCallout %}

- **Meet with licensing workers for home visits and interviews**. Let your licensing worker know if you need help meeting a requirement. Your licensing worker will connect with you to:

  - Complete interviews. At least 1 in person (others can be virtual). These can happen over multiple visits and be as long as 2 hours each. 

  - If there are 2 or more caregivers, complete:

    - At least 1 interview with the caregivers together

    - 1 interview with each caregiver individually

  - Interview **each** household member, including children. These are usually about 5-10 minutes long. Children must be interviewed in person.

  - Interview all adult children, including those you fostered.

  - Complete the home inspection. Review the [Inspection Checklist](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=10-183&title=) to learn what licensing workers are looking for.

### Initial License process

An Initial License is a temporary license that’s good for 90 days. You’ll have it while you're completing the Kinship Licensing process. 

- **Answer a phone call** from the Licensing Division and confirm you want an Initial License. Expect this call about 2 weeks after placement. {%- Callout -%}If you have not gotten a phone call after 2 weeks, ask your caseworker or Tribal worker to connect you with the Licensing Division.{%- endCallout %}

- **Get your Initial License**. DCYF will send your license via email or mail within a few weeks of the phone call. 

- **Get Initial License payments**. Once DCYF issues your Initial License, you’ll be able to get foster care payments. At the end of each month, DCYF will send you an invoice. You’ll need to claim it to receive your check. It takes about 45 days from placement to get your first check. Learn [how to get foster care payments](./payments-how/). {%- Callout -%}Initial License payments are only available for 90 days after DCYF issues the license. If DCYF does not approve your full Kinship License within 90 days, you’ll have a gap in payments. Payments will resume when DCYF issues the full license.{%- endCallout %}

### Kinship License process

Your DCYF or CPA licensing worker will help you complete the Kinship License process. You may begin this process before DCYF approves your Initial License. 

- **Complete all outstanding requests**. Ensure you’ve completed all paperwork and home study requirements. Check in with your licensing worker to make sure your application is complete. 

- **Get your Kinship License**. If you’re approved, you’ll get your license either via email or mail. If your application is denied, you will be notified and you will have appeal rights.

- **Receive Kinship License payments**. Once DCYF approves your Kinship License, you can continue getting foster care payments. The process to [get payments](./payments-how/) is the same as the Initial License. In some cases, your [rate will be higher](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/new-caregiver-supports-rates-begin-jan-1).
