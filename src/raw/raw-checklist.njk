This checklist outlines the licensing process and what you need to do at each step.

### Decide whether to get licensed

Whether you get licensed or not, you'll need to complete background checks and a home study. DCYF will also provide support and some financial help.

A license means you must follow Washington state requirements for caregivers. You're also eligible for monthly foster care payments.

If you decide to remain unlicensed, you will not get foster care payments from DCYF. 

### Initial License process

An Initial License is a temporary license you'll hold while you're completing the Kinship Licensing process. It's good for 90 days. Here are the steps:

<ul class="checklist">
  <li>
    <strong>Answer a phone call</strong> from the Licensing Division to begin the Initial Licensing process. Expect this call about 2 weeks after placement. {% Callout %}If you have not gotten a phone call after 2 weeks, ask your caseworker or Tribal worker to connect you with the Licensing Division.{% endCallout %}
  </li>

  <li><strong>Get your Initial License.</strong> DCYF will issue your license within a few weeks of the phone call.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Get Initial License payments.</strong> Once DCYF issues your Initial License, you’ll be able to get foster care payments. At the end of each month, DCYF will send you an invoice. You’ll need to claim it to receive your check. It can take up to 45 days from placement to get your first check. Learn <a href="#">how to receive foster care payments.</a> {% Callout %}Initial License payments are only available for 90 days after DCYF issues the license. If DCYF does not approve your full Kinship License within 90 days, you’ll have a gap in payments. Payments will resume when DCYF issues the full license.{% endCallout %}
  </li>
</ul>

### Kinship License process

Your licensing worker will help you complete the Kinship License process. You may begin this process before DCYF approves your Initial License. Here are the steps:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decide who to work with.</strong> You can work with DCYF’s Licensing Division, a private child placing agency (CPA), or a Tribal CPA. A CPA can be a good choice if you want more ongoing support or an agency that reflects your culture. You can change agencies even after you get a license. Learn about <a href="https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147">CPA options</a>.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Get fingerprinted.</strong> You and <strong>each</strong> member of your household over age 18 need to be fingerprinted. Youth over age 16 may need to be fingerprinted if they have lived out of state. First, you’ll be asked to complete an online or paper form. Then, you'll receive an email with instructions to set up appointments. You need to complete these within 14 days of placement. {% Callout %}Washington DCYF is committed to keeping children with relatives or kin. They'll work with you to understand background check results. In most cases, criminal records will not prevent licensing. Talk about your individual circumstances with your assigned licensing worker. Learn about <a href="https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/secretaryslist.pdf">crimes that may prevent DCYF from licensing you.</a>{% endCallout %}
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Complete and submit your application.</strong> A DCYF worker will help you complete your home study application.{% Callout %}If more than one adult is getting licensed, think about whose name you should list first. They’ll be the one receiving payments. A collector can take foster care payments if you have unresolved debts.{% endCallout %}
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Meet with licensing workers for home visits and interviews.</strong> After you turn in your home study application, you'll be assigned a licensing worker. Let your licensing worker know if you need help meeting a requirement. Your licensing worker will connect with you to:
    <ul>
      <li>Complete interviews. At least one in person (others can be virtual). These can happen over as many as 3 visits and be as long as 2 hours each.</li>
      <li>If there are 2 or more caregivers, complete:
        <ul>
          <li>At least one interview with the caregivers together</li>
          <li>Another interview with each caregiver individually</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Interview <strong>each</strong> household member, including children. These are usually about 5-10 minutes long and children must be interviewed in person.</li>
      <li>Contact your adult children who live outside the home.</li>
      <li>Complete the home inspection. Review the <a href="https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=10-183&title=">Inspection Checklist</a> to learn what licensing workers are looking for.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Get your Kinship License.</strong> If you're approved, you'll get your license either via email or mail. </li>

  <li><strong>Receive Kinship License payments.</strong> Once DCYF approves your Kinship License, you can continue getting foster care payments. The process to <a href="#">get payments</a> is the same as the Initial License. In some cases, your <a href="https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/new-caregiver-supports-rates-begin-jan-1">rate will be higher.</a></li>
</ul>
