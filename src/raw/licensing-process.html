Since all kinship caregivers need to complete most of the licensing requirements during the home study process,  we recommend all kinship caregivers get licensed. Licensed kinship caregivers get monthly payments to reimburse the costs of caring for a child or youth (these are called [monthly foster care payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments)).

After we place a child or youth in your home, we’ll also call you to ask if you want a temporary license (usually an “initial license”). The initial license lets you get foster care payments, while you complete the full kinship licensing process.

You do not need an initial license to get a full kinship license. You can start the full kinship license without getting approved for an initial license. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}









If you have a [voluntary placement](https://dcyf.wa.gov/4300-case-planning/4307-voluntary-placement-agreement), you are not eligible for kinship licensing. Voluntary placements happen **without** a court order. They are short-term agreements between parents and DCYF.









{% endCallout %}

### Get started

Begin with these two steps:

* **Decide whether to get licensed**. Getting licensed is optional. You’ll be completing most of the steps to get licensed as part of placement, so DCYF encourages you to get licensed.  
* **Decide who to work with**. Only DCYF offers the initial license. For the full kinship license you can work with DCYF, [](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147)a [private or tribal child placing agency](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/cpas-and-tribal-cpas/) (CPA). A child placing agency can be a good choice if you want more ongoing support or an agency that reflects your culture. 

### How to become a kinship caregiver

Whether you get licensed or not, you’ll need to meet several [requirements](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/) so a child or youth can remain in your care. 

#### When you'll do this

In some cases, you'll complete these steps after we’ve already placed the child or youth in your home (for example, in emergency placements). In other cases, you'll go complete these steps before we place the child or youth in your home. 

#### Steps to follow

* **Get fingerprinted for [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/)**. You and **each** member of your household age 18 and over need to be fingerprinted. Youth age 16 and over will need to be fingerprinted if they have lived out of state within the last three years. First, you’ll complete an online or paper form. Then, you’ll receive an email instructing you how to set up appointments. You need to complete these appointments within **10 days** of placement. Learn more about background checks. 
* **Complete and submit your home study application**. A licensing worker will help you complete your [home study](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/home-study-process/) application online. They will send you an email with instructions to access the Washington Caregiver Application Portal (WA CAP). WA CAP is part of Secure Access Washington (SAW). 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}





If you choose to get licensed and want more than one adult on the license, think about whose name you should list first. They’ll be the one receiving payments.





{% endCallout %}

* **Meet with licensing workers for home visits and interviews**. Let your licensing worker know if you need help meeting a requirement. Your licensing worker will connect with you to:

  * Complete interviews. At least one in person (others can be virtual). These can happen over multiple visits and be as long as two hours each. 
  * If there are two or more caregivers, complete:

    * At least one interview with the caregivers together
    * One interview with each caregiver individually
  * Interview **each** household member, including children. These are usually about 5-10 minutes long. Children must be interviewed in person.
  * Interview all adult children you've parented. We usually do this by phone if they no longer live with you. 
  * Complete the home inspection. Review the [inspection checklist](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=10-183&title=) to learn what licensing workers are looking for.

### Additional steps for getting a kinship license

Your DCYF, or private or tribal [child placing agency](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147) licensing worker will help you complete the kinship license process. 

#### When you'll do this
You can start this process without an initial license. **You do not need an initial license before you get a full kinship license.**  

#### Steps to follow
* **Complete all remaining requests**. Ensure you’ve completed all paperwork and home study interviews. Check in with your licensing worker to make sure your application is complete.
* **Get your kinship license**. If you’re approved, you’ll get your license either via email or mail. If we [deny](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-denials-suspensions-revocations) your application, we'll notify you, and you'll have [the right to appeal](https://dcyf.wa.gov/board-of-appeals). A denial of your application does not mean we'll remove the child or youth from your care.
* **Receive foster care payments**. Once DCYF approves your kinship license, you can get foster care payments. Learn more about [the process to get payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments-foster-care).

If there’s a rule for kinship caregivers that you cannot follow, tell your licensor. In rare cases, we may approve an exemption, and give you a license. We must find that you can provide for the safety, health, and well-being of the kinship child or youth.

### Getting an initial license 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}





If you have been licensed in the last five years and need a temporary license, you may be eligible for a **provisional expedited license**. Contact DCYF for more information. For everyone else, follow the steps here for an **initial license**.





{% endCallout %}

The initial license lets you get foster care payments while you complete the kinship licensing process. The initial license is good for 90 days. 

#### When you'll do this

After we place the child or youth in your home, our Licensing Division will contact you about two weeks later to ask if you want an initial license.  

#### Steps to follow 
* **Answer a phone call** from the Licensing Division and confirm you want an initial license. If you do not get a call after two weeks, ask your caseworker or tribal worker to connect you with our Licensing Division. 
* **Complete name and date of birth background checks**, if you have not already done this for the full kinship licensing process. You, everyone age 16 and older in your home, and everyone age 16 and older on your property who has unsupervised access to the child or youth will need to complete these background checks. (The exceptions are parents or guardians of the kinship child or youth who are approved to live in the home, and Someone who is allowed to live in the home with the kinship child or youth because of a court order.)
* **Get your initial license**. DCYF will send your license via email or mail within a few weeks of the phone call. 
* **Get foster care payments**. After DCYF issues your initial license, you’ll be able to get foster care payments for up to three months. At the end of each month, DCYF will send you an invoice. You’ll need to claim it to receive your check. It takes about 45 days from placement to get your first check. Learn [how to get foster care payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments-foster-care). 

If your initial license expires before you get the full kinship license, we will not remove the child or youth from your care.
