As of 2025, Washington has new rules to make it easier for kinship caregivers to become licensed. There are two main [types of licenses](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-types/):

* The **kinship license** is good for three years. With a kinship license you're eligible for [monthly foster care payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments).
* **Temporary licenses** are 90-day licenses that allow you to receive monthly foster care payments while you complete the Kinship License application process. There are two temporary licenses:

  * The **initial license**, available for new applicants.
  * The **provisional expedited license**, available for applicants who had a foster or kinship license within the last five years.

If you decide to remain unlicensed, you will not get monthly foster care payments from DCYF. But, DCYF will still provide support and some [financial help](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments).


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}







If you have a [voluntary placement](https://dcyf.wa.gov/4300-case-planning/4307-voluntary-placement-agreement), you are not eligible for kinship licensing. Voluntary placements happen **without** a court order. They are short-term agreements between parents and DCYF.







{% endCallout %}

### Get started

Begin with these two steps:

* **Decide whether to get licensed**. Getting licensed is optional. You’ll be completing most of the steps to get licensed as part of placement, so DCYF encourages you to get licensed.  
* **Decide who to work with**. Only DCYF offers the initial license. For the full kinship license you can work with DCYF, [](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147)a [private or tribal child placing agency](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/cpas-and-tribal-cpas/) (CPA). A child placing agency can be a good choice if you want more ongoing support or an agency that reflects your culture. 

### Placement requirements

Whether you get licensed or not, you’ll need to meet several [requirements](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/) so the child can remain in your care. These steps are also required for licensing.

* **Get fingerprinted for [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/)**. You and **each** member of your household age 18 and over need to be fingerprinted. Youth age 16 and over will need to be fingerprinted if they have lived out of state within the last three years. First, you’ll complete an online or paper form. Then, you’ll receive an email instructing you how to set up appointments. You need to complete these appointments within **10 days** of placement. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}


Washington DCYF is committed to keeping children with relatives or kin. They’ll work with you to understand background check results. In most cases, criminal records will not prevent licensing. Talk about your individual circumstances with your licensing worker. Learn about [crimes that may prevent DCYF from licensing you](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/secretaryslist.pdf).


{% endCallout %}

* **Complete and submit your application**. A licensing worker will help you complete your [home study](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/home-study-process/) application online. They will send you an email with instructions to access the Washington Caregiver Application Portal (WA CAP). WA CAP is part of Secure Access Washington (SAW). 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}



If you choose to get licensed and want more than one adult on the license, think about whose name you should list first. They’ll be the one receiving payments.



{% endCallout %}

* **Meet with licensing workers for home visits and interviews**. Let your licensing worker know if you need help meeting a requirement. Your licensing worker will connect with you to:

  * Complete interviews. At least one in person (others can be virtual). These can happen over multiple visits and be as long as two hours each. 
  * If there are two or more caregivers, complete:

    * At least one interview with the caregivers together
    * One interview with each caregiver individually
  * Interview **each** household member, including children. These are usually about 5-10 minutes long. Children must be interviewed in person.
  * Interview all adult children you've parented.
  * Complete the home inspection. Review the [inspection checklist](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=10-183&title=) to learn what licensing workers are looking for.

### Temporary license process


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}



If you have been licensed in the last five years and need a temporary license, you may be eligible for a **provisional expedited license**. Contact DCYF for more information. For everyone else, follow the **initial license** application process.



{% endCallout %}

The initial license enables you to get foster care payments while you complete the kinship licensing process. The initial license is good for 90 days. DCYF will not remove the child from your care just because you took longer than 90 days to complete the process. DCYF is committed to working with you to help you complete this process. 

* **Answer a phone call** from the Licensing Division and confirm you want an initial license. Expect this call about 2 weeks after placement. 
* **Complete name and date of birth background checks**, if you have not already done this for the full kinship licensing process. You, everyone age 16 and older in your home, and everyone age 16 and older on your property who has unsupervised access to the child or youth will need to complete these background checks. (The exceptions are parents or guardians of the kinship child or youth who are approved to live in the home, and Someone who is allowed to live in the home with the kinship child or youth because of a court order.)
* **Get your initial license**. DCYF will send your license via email or mail within a few weeks of the phone call. 
* **Get initial license payments**. Once DCYF issues your initial license, you’ll be able to get foster care payments. At the end of each month, DCYF will send you an invoice. You’ll need to claim it to receive your check. It takes about 45 days from placement to get your first check. Learn [how to get foster care payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments-foster-care). 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}



Initial license payments are only available for 90 days after DCYF issues the license. If DCYF does not approve your full kinship license within 90 days, you’ll have a gap in payments. Payments will resume when DCYF issues the full license.



{% endCallout %}

### Kinship license process

Your DCYF, or private or tribal [child placing agency](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147) licensing worker will help you complete the kinship license process. You may begin this process before DCYF approves your initial license. 

* **Complete all remaining requests**. Ensure you’ve completed all paperwork and home study interviews. Check in with your licensing worker to make sure your application is complete.
* **Get your kinship license**. If you’re approved, you’ll get your license either via email or mail. If your application is [denied](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-denials-suspensions-revocations), you will be notified and you will have [appeal rights](https://dcyf.wa.gov/board-of-appeals). A denial of your application is not a reason for DCYF to remove the child from your care.
* **Receive kinship license payments**. Once DCYF approves your kinship license, you can continue getting foster care payments. The process to [get payments](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/payments-foster-care) is the same as the initial license. In some cases, your [rate will be higher](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/new-caregiver-supports-rates-begin-jan-1).
