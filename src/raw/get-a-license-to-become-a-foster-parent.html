We need more foster parents to give children and youth safe, loving, temporary homes. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
If you’re interested in or already caring for a friend or relative’s child, you may be eligible to apply to become a “kinship caregiver,” instead of a foster parent. This means you may be able to go through a faster and easier licensing process.

Learn more about who we consider a kinship caregiver. \[add link]

[Learn about the process to care for a friend or relative’s child](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/becoming-kinship-caregiver/placement-requirements#steps)**.**
{% endCallout %}

There are several steps to getting a foster parent license:

* Step 1: Learn more about becoming a foster parent
* Step 2: Make sure you meet licensing requirements
* Step 3: Choose an agency to work with
* Step 4: Complete trainings
* Step 5: Submit your application
* Step 6: Complete the home study, background checks, and medical requirements
* Step 7: Receive your license

After you submit your application in Step 5, it usually takes about four months to receive your license. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
If you have questions at any point during the licensing process, you can contact us for help. \[add link]
{% endCallout %}



## **Step 1: Learn more about becoming a foster parent**

When you’re ready to move forward, contact us so we can answer your questions and guide you through the licensing process. Connect with us in one of three ways: 

* Fill out the [Foster Parent Inquiry form](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/questionnaire). Our recruitment team will email you within two business days.
* Call 1-888-KIDS-414. 
* Attend [an online information session about becoming a foster parent](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/become-a-foster-parent/info-sessions). 

## **Step 2: Make sure you meet licensing requirements**

We welcome foster parents from all backgrounds, including: 

* People from all racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds 
* People who are single, partnered, or married
* Renters and homeowners 
* People who are LGBTQ+
* People with any education level 

### **Licensing requirements**

You have to meet these requirements:

* Be at least 21 years old 
* Go through a [home study process](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/becoming-kinship-caregiver/home-study-process), and show us that you have the ability, physical health, and emotional stability to meet foster children and youth’s needs
* Have enough money to care for your family, including a foster child or youth, without foster care payments. \[add link] We encourage you to apply even if you’re concerned you may not meet this requirement.
* Be able to receive and respond to communications with children and youth, DCYF, Tribes, health care providers, and other service providers
* Be willing to care for children and youth regardless of their race, ethnicity, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. DCYF will work with you to get additional training or support that you might need in order to care for a specific child. 
* Make sure anyone you live with or who you plan to leave alone with children and youth will provide a safe, nurturing, and respectful environment for them
* Once you are licensed, fulfill all foster parent roles and responsibilities \[add link] and follow all guidance and instructions from children and youth’s caseworkers and from your Child Placing Agency (CPA)
* Maintain the child or youth’s connections with their biological family and other people in their community. DCYF’s number one priority is reunifying children and youth with their parents. If a child or youth cannot return to their parents, we look for kin who can care for the child or youth. 

In general, any adult who does an equal share of the caregiving for foster children and youth needs to be licensed. For example, if you live with a sibling and plan to care for foster children and youth together, both you and your sibling need to get licensed. But if you plan to do the majority of the caregiving and your sibling will only be helping out occasionally, your sibling may not need to get licensed.

**Married couples are required to get licensed together,** and unmarried couples usually do as well. Your licensing worker can help you understand who in your household should be licensed.


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
Our priority is to reunite children and youth with their parents. When reunification is not possible, we look for kin who can take care of the child. Guardianship and adoption by foster parents are only options for children and youth who cannot return to their parents and do not have any kin available to care for them. 

People who want to adopt Washington state foster children or youth must become fully licensed as foster parents.

DCYF does not complete adoption-only home studies. Working with a private adoption agency may be a better fit for your family if you are not open to maintaining family connections or are not open to caring for a child with special needs. [Learn more about adoption](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/adoption).
{% endCallout %}



#### **Exceptions to licensing requirements**

If there’s a specific reason you cannot meet one of the licensing requirements, you may be able to get an exception. Submit a written request for an exception to your licensing worker. You must describe why you need the exception, and how you’ll continue to provide for foster children and youth’s health, safety, and well-being.  

## **Step 3: Choose a licensing agency**

The next step is to choose a licensing agency. 

You can get licensed by DCYF, a CPA, or a Tribal CPA. 

[Learn more about licensing agencies and how to choose one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_iWpMXE2mIuRUQrDwptltsMtj7ZS1V_tubQ-UKy5qGc/edit?tab=t.7guq7lkv7q22).

## **Step 4: Complete trainings** 

Before submitting your application, you have to complete some trainings.

### **Required trainings**

**Anyone who is applying for a foster parent license** needs to complete these trainings: 

* **Caregiver Core Training (CCT)**: CCT is a free online learning course that you complete at your own pace. [Register for CCT](https://alliance.exceedlms.com/student/path/2592278-caregiver-core-training).
* * **“While You Wait” webinar:** After you complete the initial CCT training, you’ll receive a link to sign up for this webinar. A current caregiver and mentor in the Alliance’s CaRES program (Caregiver Retention, Education, and Support program) will share more about how to get ready to foster. Your CCT is not complete until you have attended this webinar.
* **Mandatory reporter training:** [Register for free mandatory reporter training through our partner the Alliance](https://risewiththealliance.org/).

We also require two other trainings for **anyone who is applying for a foster parent license, as well as anyone else 18 or older who will interact with foster children or youth**. This requirement applies both to people who live with you and people who visit regularly. For example, if you and your spouse are applying to become foster parents and you have an adult child who will interact with foster children or youth, then you, your spouse, and your adult child need to complete the two trainings listed here:   

* **First aid and CPR training:** Search online for an in-person class near you that fits the age group you want to care for. Adult (ages 12 and over), child (under the age of 12), and infant certifications are available. You can also find a class through the Red Cross or your local fire department. Confirm with the trainer that the class meets national standards set by the American Heart Association. 

Keep your receipt and certification card. 

You’ll need to pay for this training on your own. After you get a foster care license, we’ll reimburse you. Give your receipt and certification card to your licensing worker. 

If you already have up-to-date CPR training, you do not need to take the training again. If you cannot complete this training for medical reasons, you can ask your licensing worker if you can get an exception. 

* **Bloodborne pathogens and infection control:** [Register for free training about bloodborne pathogens.](https://alliance.exceedlms.com/student/activity/2658401-bloodborne-pathogens) (If your CPR training covers bloodborne pathogens and it’s on your certificate, you do not need to take this training.) 

Learn more about the required trainings and how to complete them. \[add link]


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
Make sure to keep all documentation that shows you have completed your trainings.
{% endCallout %}



## **Step 5: Submit your application**

Once you have completed your trainings, tell us you’re ready to apply. 

[Use our map to find the DCYF region you live in](https://dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pubs/COMM_0008.pdf).

If you want to get licensed through a CPA \[add link], then [review our list of CPAs that work in your DCYF region](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/child-placing-agencies/cpa-contacts). Contact a CPA, and follow their instructions for how to apply. 

If you want to get licensed through DCYF, then select the link for your region to find your local licensing team. Tell them you’re ready to apply by emailing the licensing team for your region:

* Email the Region 1 licensing team  
* Email the Region 2 licensing team 
* Email the Region 3 licensing team 
* Email the Region 4 licensing team 
* Email the Region 5 licensing team 
* Email the Region 6 licensing team 

The team will send you instructions for how to apply in our online portal. 

Once you start your application, you have to submit supporting documents listed in the online portal within 90 calendar days. Examples of supporting documents can include your immunization records, insurance information, and proof of income. If you do not finish submitting documents within 90 days, we may close your application. You’ll have to start your application over again. 

If you’ve had a foster care license in Washington state in the last five years, you may be eligible for a temporary license (also called a provisional expedited license) while you complete the full licensing process. Contact the DCYF licensing team in your region for more information.

## **Step 6: Complete the home study, background checks, and medical requirements**

A licensing worker will visit your home, and talk with you and other members of your household. They’ll also complete a home inspection to make sure your home is safe. 

[Learn more about the home study process and how to prepare for it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_iWpMXE2mIuRUQrDwptltsMtj7ZS1V_tubQ-UKy5qGc/edit?tab=t.1z7wc2xa14n2#heading=h.78yhz8j8x4zv).

### **Background checks**

You’ll need to complete background checks. Everyone who lives on your property or who will have unsupervised access to foster children and youth will also need to complete background checks. 

You will not automatically fail a background check if you have a criminal history. 

Learn more about the background check process. \[add link]

### **Medical requirements**

You must meet these medical requirements before you get a license:

#### **Tuberculosis (TB) screening**

Everyone 18 and older who lives in your home must complete our tuberculosis (TB) screening form in the online application portal (WACAP). If the screening form indicates that you or anyone who lives in your home needs to be tested for TB, you must follow through with that testing. 

Give your licensing worker copies of all the documentation that the TB screening form requires.

#### **Vaccinations**

Any children or youth who already live with you must get all vaccinations on the [Washington State Department of Health’s immunization schedule](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/immunization). If you have concerns about meeting the vaccination requirements, talk to your licensing worker.

If you plan to care for children who are younger than two years old or who are medically fragile, then everyone in your household must have current pertussis (whooping cough) and annual flu vaccines.

You must give your licensing worker written proof (your immunization records, or a statement from your vaccination provider) that your household has met these requirements.

## **Step 7: Receive your license**

Your licensing worker will provide you with a copy of your license. They will also confirm your licensed capacity \[add link], which means who you can care for with your license.


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
Your license will be valid for three years. It only applies to the names and addresses listed on your application. It cannot be transferred to anyone else.
{% endCallout %}

You’ll need to keep a copy of your license in your home, and be ready to show it to your licensing worker if we ask.

After you get your license, what happens next depends on whether you worked with a CPA to get licensed. If you did, the CPA will get in touch with you about having a child or youth placed with you. If you did not work with a CPA, you will work directly with DCYF to start the placement process.
