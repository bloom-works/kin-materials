{% Callout "note", "Note" %}

This information is for kinship caregivers of children and youth in DCYF’s care only. If a Tribe has placed a child or youth with you, contact the Tribe, or the Tribal caseworker, for more information on the first two months of placement.

{% endCallout %}



## **What to expect in the first 10 days of placement**

In the first days of your kinship child's placement, there’s a lot that happens. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed or confused. 

Here’s what to expect in the first 10 days of placement:

* **A caseworker will visit you and your kinship child** at home during their first week with you. This is called a Health and Safety Visit. The caseworker will check in on how things are going, look at where the child sleeps, and talk about the child’s well-being. They’ll also spend some time alone with the child to hear their perspective.
* **The child or youth will have family time visits** with their parents and siblings. Support your kinship child's connection to their parent or parents, and siblings by following the court and the caseworker's instructions about family time. [Learn more about family time visitation](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/FamTimeFAQs.pdf).

If Child Protective Services recently removed the child or youth from their parents, and this is child or youth’s first placement outside of their home, these things will also happen: 

* There will be a **Family Team Decision Making (FTDM) meeting** within 72 hours. Sometimes this meeting happens before the placement starts. This meeting is an opportunity to learn more about the reasons the child or youth is experiencing foster care. The child’s parents have to agree for you to attend this meeting. We strongly encourage you to attend this meeting if possible!
* **There will be a court "shelter care hearing" within the first three days**. Read more about [what happens at a shelter care hearing](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library?combine_1=CWP_0065&combine=&field_program_topic_value=All&field_languages_available_value=All).
* **You’ll get an interim voucher** that allows you to access medical care for the child or youth while you wait for their medical insurance coverage card to arrive. You can also ask the caseworker to look up the child or youth's Provider One or Apple Health Core Connections identification number in DCYF’s system.
* **The state will mail you the child or youth’s medical insurance coverage card.** You can also ask the caseworker to look up the young person's Provider One or Apple Health Core Connections identification number in FamLink.


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
It’s helpful to put all the paperwork you receive in one folder or binder. Whenever you go to a meeting or meet with a caseworker, bring it with you and add to it. This way, you have what you need when speaking with different professionals.
{% endCallout %}



## **What you need to do**

There are a few things you'll need to do after your kinship child is placed in your home.

### **Education**

* **Keep the child or youth enrolled in and attending the same school.** If you believe the child or youth should move to a new school, please talk with the caseworker. The child or youth can only change schools if you go through a “best interest determination” meeting. 
* **If a new school placement is approved, enroll the child or youth in a new school within three days.** 
* **Request copies of the child or youth’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP), or 504 Plan, if they have one.**
* If the student has outstanding school fees or fines, send the bills to the caseworker to pay them. 

If you need help, contact the caseworker or ask to speak with the [school district’s foster care liaison](https://ospi.k12.wa.us/student-success/accessopportunity-education/foster-care/foster-careliaisonsdcyf-contactsschool-contacts). 

[Learn more about your roles and responsibilities related to the child or youth’s education](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/roles-responsibilities/education).

### **Health care**

* **Schedule a dental exam if a child or youth has one or more teeth.** Within the first 30 calendar days of placement, you must contact a dentist and make an appointment for an initial dental examination. The exam must occur within the first 60 days of placement.
* **Schedule an initial medical appointment** using one of the following options:

  * Option 1:

    * Schedule an initial health screen within the first five days of placement AND
    * Schedule an EPSDT or Well Child exam within 30 days of coming into care.
  * Option 2:

    * Schedule an EPSDT or Well-Child exam within the first five days of placement.
* **Make sure you have the child or youth’s medications**. When the child or youth arrives at your home, the caseworker is responsible for giving you the medications they take. Bring the medications to the child or youth’s medical appointments. Use the interim voucher for medical care to get refills. You can use the same pharmacy, or use a different pharmacy. 
* **Talk with the caseworker first if you think the child or youth needs changes to their medications**. The caseworker needs to get permission before any changes to medications.

### **Record keeping**

* **Keep records that you receive for the child or youth, and maintain them** (also called a well-being file). Add this information to their file, if it’s not already there: 

  * The child or youth’s name and birth date
  * The names and phone numbers of the caseworker, guardian ad litem, child advocate, and attorney
  * Medical information, immunization records, and medication records 
  * Written consent for providing medical care and emergency surgery, as authorized by a court order
  *  A list of the child or youth’s personal belongings. Keep this list updated with any items they get while they live with you.  
  * The names, addresses, and phone numbers of emergency contacts
  * The names, addresses, and phone numbers for people who are allowed to have unsupervised access to the child or youth 
  * Any specific cultural, social, and emotional needs that the child or youth has
* **Keep track of transportation expenses** on the [Caregiver Monthly Transportation Reimbursement form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=07-090&title=) and turn in complete forms to the caseworker to get reimbursed.

### **Working with the caseworker** 

* **Tell the caseworker about any unplanned parent-child contact,** such as phone calls or unexpected visits.
* **Share any concerns about the child or youth with the caseworker.** Examples include abuse, neglect, medical, behavioral, developmental, or educational issues. If the child or youth tells you something that worries you, do not ask follow-up questions yourself. Instead, listen carefully, let the child or youth know that you heard them, and report what they told you to the caseworker.
* **Tell the caseworker the dates, times, and purposes of any appointments** that you set up for the child or youth.
* **Work with DCYF to arrange subsidized child care if you plan to use child care.** The caseworker can give you a referral for a child care center that accepts DCYF payments. You cannot arrange or pay for child care on your own. This is to make sure that when the child is reunified with their family, the state can continue to pay for them to receive the same care. Connect with [Child Care Aware of Washington](https://childcareawarewa.org/) for help finding child care near you. 

### **Steps to continue care**

To [keep the child or youth in your care](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/becoming-kinship-caregiver/placement-requirements), you'll also need to **complete the steps listed here.** DCYF will guide you through these steps:

* Get fingerprinted for background checks. All household members ages 16 and older pass a background check, and those aged 18 and older must submit fingerprints.
* Get a walkthrough of your home.
* Complete a home study application.
* Meet with licensing workers for home study visits and interviews.

## **How to work with the caseworker**

The caseworker is your main point of contact. The caseworker’s job is to manage the whole case, including the needs of the child or youth’s parents and family. They do this by: 

* Looking after children and youth’s safety and well-being
* Helping families reunify, or find a stable, permanent living situation for children and youth 
* Working with you, the caregiver, to meet the needs of the child or youth and their family

Caseworkers work with families to create a case plan, and report progress and challenges to the court. 

If your kinship child needs support or services, let the caseworker know.

The caseworker will visit you and the child or youth at least once a month. This will continue as long as the child or youth is in foster care. Some visits will be scheduled and others will be unannounced.

### **Communicating with the caseworker**

Save the name, phone number, and email address for the caseworker and their supervisor. This information is in your placement paperwork. You may get a lot of phone calls from them, and it’s important to answer or call back as soon as you can.

Tell the caseworker when and how you want them to reach (for example, by phone, text, or email). Ask the caseworker what works best for them, too.

If you do not know the caseworker or their supervisor’s phone number, [contact DCYF](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us). 

### **Caseworker changes**

Sometimes, we need to transfer a child or youth’s case to a new caseworker. If that happens, the previous caseworker will try to let you know.

If you think we transferred your kinship child’s case, first try to contact the previous case worker, and ask them for the name and contact information for the new caseworker. 

If you cannot reach the previous caseworker, contact their supervisor or [contact DCYF](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us).

## **Other people who will contact you**

Different professionals will contact you about your kinship child. If you have any questions about who these individuals are and what information you can discuss with them, please ask your caseworker or their supervisor.

[Learn more about who else you can contact for support](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0081).

Here are some of the professionals you might work with:

* **Alliance CaRES:** Around the first week, you will hear from your CaRES mentor. Your mentor will answer your questions and support you as you care for a child or youth. The CaRES team can also provide referrals to other resources, including training and support groups. You can reach them at alliancecares@uw.edu or 206-221-4913.
* **Child Health and Education Tracking (CHET):** A worker will contact you within 30 days of placement to help assess the child’s medical needs. 
* * If the CHET report identifies any medical needs for your kinship child, call Apple Health Core Connections at 1-844-354-9876 and ask for help with health care coordination. 
  * For help with your kinship child’s education, contact your local [school district’s foster care liaison](https://ospi.k12.wa.us/student-success/accessopportunity-education/foster-care/foster-careliaisonsdcyf-contactsschool-contacts).
* **Ongoing Mental Health (OMH) screener:** If your kinship child is aged 3 through 17, a worker will contact you as part of the follow-up to the CHET assessment. They will screen your kinship child for emotional and behavioral health needs. You can request an OMH referral at any time.
* **Child Advocates, Guardians ad Litem (GAL), and Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA):** Their role is to advocate for children in court. The kinship child’s advocate may visit your home.
* **Child’s attorney:** Children and youth over age 12 may have an attorney, and children and youth whose parents’ rights have been terminated will have an attorney. The child’s attorney may visit your home.
* **Licensing division staff:** Staff from DCYF’s licensing division will contact you to offer an initial license and help you sign into the caregiver application portal (WA CAP).

### **Ongoing considerations**

### **Financial support**

* **Initial license:** Approximately two weeks after placement, you can apply for an initial license. DCYF’s licensing division will contact you about getting an initial license. The initial license lets you get payments like a foster parent. But it can take as long as 60 days for the funds to come to you, so in the meantime we encourage you to apply for the Non-Needy TANF grant.
* **Non-Needy Child-Only TANF:** TANF is an important financial resource that provides a monthly payment to unlicensed caregivers for eligible children in their care. We strongly encourage you to apply.

  Apply for TANF [online](https://www.washingtonconnection.org/), by phone at 877-501-2233, or at your [local Community Services Office](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/office-locations). While you may be asked for information about your income, your TANF eligibility will not be based on your income because you are a kinship caregiver. If you are applying in person or calling to ask questions about TANF, be sure to let the person you are speaking with know that you are an unlicensed kinship caregiver.

If you are concerned that Child Support Enforcement will go after the child’s parents for child support, ask the Child Support Office staff at your local Department of Social and Health Services office about a Good Cause Decision. In certain cases, child support will not be considered against the parents. [Learn more about Good Cause Decisions](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sites/default/files/forms/pdf/18-334.pdf) and [find your local office](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/office-locations).

* **Monthly foster care payments for licensed caregivers:** These are the [greatest long-term financial support](https://dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library?combine_1=LIC_0045&combine=&field_program_topic_2_value=All&field_languages_available_value=All) for kinship caregivers. When you meet the [requirements to care for the child or youth](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/becoming-kinship-caregiver/placement-requirements), you'll be meeting most of the requirements to get these payments. You'll also need to agree to fulfill the [roles and responsibilities for kinship caregivers](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/roles-responsibilities). If you successfully complete this process and meet the requirements, you can get a kinship caregiver license and get monthly payments.
* **Washington Paid Family & Medical Leave:** You may be eligible for the Washington Paid Family & Medical Leave. [Learn more about eligibility and how to apply](https://paidleave.wa.gov/app/uploads/2021/06/Parents-guide-V.5-FINAL.pdf).

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
You may be able to get additional financial support for basic needs like groceries and rent, as well as vouchers for things like clothing and diapers. Ask your caseworker about accessing these supports.
{% endCallout %}



### **Support**

You are a family member as well as a kinship caregiver; juggling these roles may be challenging. You may feel sad or disappointed about why your kinship child needed to be placed in your care. You may need to use new or different parenting approaches with your kinship child. These feelings and experiences are normal. Consider attending a support group where you can meet other kinship caregivers who share similar experiences. Visit [the Alliance CaRES website](https://alliancecares.org/) to learn more.

Talk to your caseworker at monthly visits, during shared planning meetings, over the phone, or via email to share what you are experiencing. 

### **Parents**

You may be saying to yourself, "But I want these kids to go home to their parent(s). This isn't supposed to be a long-term placement." We support you in wanting your kinship child to go home. In fact, reunification is our first and primary goal, but we know that sometimes a parent may need more support or time to learn new behaviors. Even if you think your kinship child will be placed with you for a short period of time, we encourage you to get licensed and begin benefiting from the support available.
