Whether you're a licensed or unlicensed caregiver, you may be eligible for reimbursement from DCYF for certain approved costs. Learn what’s covered and how to apply.

## CPR and first aid training costs

To apply to become a foster parent or renew your foster care license, you must get first aid and CPR training. DCYF will pay you back for training after you get your license. 

### How to apply for reimbursement

* Keep a copy of your receipt from the training, and your certification card showing you’ve completed the first aid and CPR training.
* After you get your license, contact your licensing worker and give them your training receipt.
* Your licensing worker will complete the reimbursement form for you to ensure you receive your payment.

If you withdraw your foster care application or we deny your application, you will not be eligible for reimbursement. If you have any questions, contact your licensing worker.

## Mileage or transportation costs

As a caregiver, you may have to drive the child or youth or yourself to activities or appointments. DYCF will pay you back for gas mileage or transportation costs for approved activities.

### Approved activities

* Family time visits with parents or siblings
* School or extracurricular activities
* Court hearings and court-ordered activities
* Medical, dental, counseling, or WIC appointments
* Attendance at meetings at the request of DCYF staff
* Some DCYF-approved caregiver trainings
* Participation in recreational activities, practices, or lessons
* Respite care, for mileage more than 10 miles each way
* Child care, for mileage more than the caregiver's regular commute to work

If you're unsure whether an activity is approved, ask the caseworker.

If an approved appointment or activity is longer than 3 hours, DCYF will reimburse you to drop them off and pick them up later.

### How to apply for reimbursement

Complete the [Caregiver Monthly Transportation Reimbursement form](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/roles-responsibilities/payments/form-transportation) in the language of your choice. When you’ve completed the form, submit it to the caseworker.

## Property damage and emergency medical care

DYCF provides limited reimbursement for property damage and emergency medical care caused by a child. In some cases DCYF covers the result of your actions.

### Covered costs

* Property damage and loss up to $5,000.00
* Emergency medical treatment up to $1,000.00
* Emergency veterinary expenses up to $500.00
* Third party property damage, loss, emergency medical treatment, or legal fees up to $25,000.00

### Not covered

* Costs covered under a public or private insurance policy (homeowner, medical, dental)
* Costs involving a car, truck, or motorcycle
* Costs without supporting documentation (receipts or photos)
* Costs resulting from illegal activity, poor supervision, or intentional acts or omissions

### How to apply for reimbursement

* Complete the appropriate form.

  * For damage to your property or emergency medical care for a household member: [Caregiver reimbursement claim form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=18-400&title=)
  * For damage to someone else’s property or emergency medical care for someone outside your household: [Caregiver third party liability form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=18-400A&title=)
* Collect supporting documentation. You’ll need support your application with documentation, including:

  * Private insurance information, if applicable
  * Receipts, photos, and any other materials that support your claim
* Submit your application and supporting documentation to the caseworker.
  After you submit your application, respond to any new requests from the caseworker.

## Appeal options

If we deny your claim for mileage, transportation, property or emergency medical care, you have 2 options:

* Ask for an exception to the program rule that led to your denial.
* Ask for a reconsideration and include new documentation or information to support your request.

We’ll review your appeal and make a decision. Appeal decisions are final.
