If we [deny your application or revoke your kinship caregiver license](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/license-denials-suspensions-revocations), we’ll send you a certified letter with our decision about your application or license. 

You have the right to appeal our decision. Follow the instructions in the letter to request an administrative hearing. 

You must send your written request for a hearing within 28 days of receiving the certified letter. You’ll meet with a judge, and explain why you’re appealing DCYF’s decision. Learn more about [DCYF’s administrative hearing process](https://oah.wa.gov/case-preparation/hearings/department-children-youth-families/general-dcyf-hearing-information).
