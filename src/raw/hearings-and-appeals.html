If we deny, suspend, or cancel your kinship caregiver license, and you disagree with our decision, you have the right to an administrative hearing. 

You must send a written request for a hearing to the office of administrative hearings. Send your written request within 28 days of receiving a certified letter with our decision about your license. 

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}If you applied for your license through a child-placing agency and you do not agree with a CPA’s decision on your application, you must follow the CPA’s appeals process to challenge the decision.{% endCallout %}

If you did not pass a DCYF [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/), and you disagree with our decision, you can also request an administrative hearing. But you cannot appeal convictions, negative actions, or pending criminal charges at the hearing.
