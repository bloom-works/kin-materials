If we [deny, suspend, or revoke your kinship caregiver license](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-denials-suspensions-revocations), you have the right to appeal our decision by requesting an administrative hearing.

You must send a written request for a hearing to the Office of Administrative Hearings. Send your written request within 28 days of receiving a certified letter with our decision about your application or license. Learn more about [DCYF’s administrative hearing process](https://oah.wa.gov/case-preparation/hearings/department-children-youth-families/general-dcyf-hearing-information).
