If we [deny, suspend, or revoke your kinship caregiver license](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-denials-suspensions-revocations), and you disagree with our decision, you have the right to an administrative hearing.

You must send a written request for a hearing to the office of administrative hearings. Send your written request within 28 days of receiving a certified letter with our decision about your license.
