You must report the changes listed on this page to your licensing worker. DCYF, the Child Placing Agency, or the tribal Child Placing Agency may need to update your home study or do a new home study at the time of the change. 

### Changes in your home

Report changes in your home to your licensing worker **immediately**, including these situations: 

* Your address or telephone number has changed.
* Your home has structural damage. 
* You plan to change the structure of your home. 
* You plan to move. 

### Household changes

Report household changes to your licensing worker **immediately**, including these situations: 

* You have a new spouse or partner.
* You separate from your spouse or partner.
* Someone who has access to the child or youth is arrested.
* A caregiver for the child or youth dies.
* Someone moves in or out of the home or property.
* You or someone in the household has a change in physical or mental health that affects the child or youth’s care.
* You experience any medical changes, including changes to your prescription drugs, that affect your ability to care for the child or youth.

If someone age 16 or older moves into the home or onto the property, we need them to [complete a background check](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/background-checks).
