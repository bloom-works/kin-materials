The Social Services Payment System (SSPS) Provider Portal allows you to manage your payments and claim your invoices online. Follow these steps to access the SSPS Provider Portal. 

### Create a SecureAccess Washington (SAW) account

You’ll need to create a SAW account before you can sign up for the SSPS Provider Portal. 

If you already have a SAW account, sign into your account and skip to the section about [adding the SSPS Provider Portal to your SAW account](#add-the-ssps-provider-portal-to-your-saw-account).

To create your SAW account:

1. Go to the [**Sign up for an account** page on the SAW website](https://secureaccess.wa.gov/public/saw/pub/displayRegister.do).  
2. Enter your personal information. If you want, enter your contact information (optional). 
3. Create a username and strong password for your SAW account. Check the box to verify that you’re human. Then select **Create my account**.
4. Check the inbox of the personal email address you entered to create your SAW account. You’ll find an email from SecureAccess Washington. In the email, select the activation link to activate your SAW account. If the link takes you to the **Account activated** page on the SAW website, you’ve successfully activated your account.

### Add the SSPS Provider Portal to your SAW account{id=add-the-ssps-provider-portal-to-your-saw-account}

After you create and activate your SAW account, you’ll need to add the SSPS Provider Portal to your SAW account. 

Before you start, you must have this information:

* **Your security token.** To request your security token, email us at [DSHS_SSPSMail@dshs.wa.gov](mailto:DSHS_SSPSMail@dshs.wa.gov). Or, call us at [360-664-6161](tel:+13606646161). We’re here Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT.   
* **Your 6-digit SSPS provider or payee number.** Your provider and payee number are the same number. You can find your provider number on your SSPS invoices. If you do not know your provider number, email us at [DSHS_SSPSMail@dshs.wa.gov](mailto:DSHS_SSPSMail@dshs.wa.gov). Or, call us at [360-664-6161](tel:+13606646161).  
* **Your agency code.** You’ll need to use this agency code: **2795**.

{% Callout "note" %}If you have more than one SSPS provider number, you’ll need to create a separate SAW account for each provider number. And you’ll need to use a different username for each SAW account. But you can use the same email address for each account.{% endCallout %}

After you get this information:

1. Go to the [SAW website](https://secureaccess.wa.gov/myAccess/saw/select.do) and sign into your account. 
2. After you sign in, select **Add a new service**. Then select **I have been given a code by an agency**. 
3. Enter the agency code **2795**. Then select **Submit**.

4. Enter your 6-digit SSPS provider or payee number.  
5. Enter your first and last name. And enter the security token you got from the SSPS Customer Service Team. Then select **Submit**.  
6. If you get a **Registration complete** page, you’ve successfully added the SSPS Provider Portal to your SAW account. Select **OK** to go back to the **Services** page.

   If you do not get a **Registration complete** page, email us at [DSHS_SSPSMAIL@dshs.wa.gov](mailto:DSHS_SSPSMAIL@dshs.wa.gov). Include your SSPS provider number in the email so we can help you.

### Set up multifactor authentication to secure your SAW account

After you add the SSPS Provider Portal to your SAW account and select **Access now**, you’ll need to set up multifactor authentication. 

Multifactor authentication helps us keep your account safe and secure. With multifactor authentication, you’ll get a unique verification code through email or text message any time you try to access the SSPS Provider Portal. And you’ll need to enter the code to securely access the portal.

To set up multifactor authentication:

1. Choose if you would like to get your verification code through email or text message. You’ll get your code sent to whichever method you select.\
   ![A screenshot of the process for adding multi-factor authentication.](/assets/images/ssps-mfa.png)
2. Enter your verification code. Then select **Submit**.
3. You'll be asked if you want SAW to remember your device. Do not select the "Yes, remember my device" option or you may experience technical issues. Select **Submit**.
4. You’ll now be able to access the SSPS Provider Portal from your SAW account if you  select **Continue**.
