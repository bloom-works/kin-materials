This page lists the requirements for each type of license for kinship caregivers. Your licensor will work with you to complete the licensing process. They can also answer any questions you may have.

### Kinship caregiver license

If you’re applying for a full kinship caregiver license, work with your licensor to complete the licensing process.

As part of the process, you must do all of the following: 

* Provide the required documents listed in the online WA Caregiver Application Portal.
* Confirm that you’re at least 18 years old.
* Pass a background check.
* Take part in a home study.
* Take part in an inspection of your home.
* In rare cases, take part in any further assessments we may need (e.g. a health assessment based on your mental health or substance use history). 

Make sure everyone in your home or on your property who is age 16 and older who will have unsupervised access to the kinship child or youth passes a [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks).

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}We’ll try to work with you and support you to get licensed. In rare cases, we may approve an exemption to the licensing requirements and give you a license. We must find that you can provide for the safety, health, and well-being of the kinship child or youth.{% endCallout %}

If you already have an initial license, you must submit your application for a full license within 90 days of getting the initial license. Otherwise, your monthly foster care maintenance payments will stop until you get the full license.

If you do not take part in the licensing process, DCYF or the child-placing agency may withdraw your application for a license.

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}If other children or youth who are not on the license come to live with you, you must have an updated assessment within 90 days of their placement.{% endCallout %}

### Initial license

You can get an initial license if all of these are true: 

* A kinship child or youth currently lives with you.
* You agree to get an initial license.
* Everyone in your home or on your property who is age 16 and older and who has unsupervised access to the kinship child or youth has started the [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks) process, except:

  * Parents or guardians who are approved to live in the home.
  * Someone who is allowed to live in the home with the kinship child or youth because of a court order, when there is a supervision plan in place.

### Provisional expedited license

You must complete and submit an application for a provisional expedited license to DCYF or a child-placing agency. 

You can apply if all of the following are true: 

* You’ve received a foster or kinship caregiver license within the last five years.
* We did not deny or cancel your license, and you did not have an agreement to relinquish (give up) your license.
* You live in the same home where you last received your license.
* There are no additional household members since you last received a license.
* The same CPA that licensed or certified you last time will supervise your expedited kinship license.
* You and other people in your household have passed the required [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks).

If we decide you do not meet the requirements to get a provisional expedited license, you cannot appeal our decision. We’ll continue to work with you so you can become fully licensed to be a kinship caregiver.
