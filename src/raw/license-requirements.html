This page lists the requirements for each type of license for kinship caregivers. Your licensor will work with you to complete the licensing process. They can also answer any questions you may have. 

### Kinship caregiver license

If you’re applying for a full kinship caregiver license, work with your licensor to complete the licensing process. 

As part of the process, you must do all of the following: 

* Provide the required documents listed in the online WA Caregiver Application Portal 
* Verify that you’re at least 18 years old
* Pass a background check
* Participate in a home study
* Participate in an inspection of your home
* Participate in additional assessments we deem necessary (this may happen in rare circumstances if the kinship child or youth has safety and specific needs including, but not limited to mental health, substance abuse, or collaterals) 

All of these people must also pass a [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks):

* Everyone in your home or on your property who is age 16 and older who will have unsupervised access to the kinship child or youth 

If you already have an initial license, you must submit your application for a full license within 90 days of getting the initial license. Otherwise, your monthly foster care maintenance payments will stop until you get the full license.

If you do not engage in the licensing process, DCYF or the child-placing agency may withdraw your application for a license.

### Initial license 

You can get an initial license if all of these are true: 

* A kinship child or youth currently lives with you
* You agree to get an initial license
* All of these people have a conditionally approved [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks): 
* * Everyone in your home or on your property who is age 16 and older and who has unsupervised access to the kinship child or youth 

Note: The following people do not need conditionally approved background checks: 

* Parents or guardians who are approved to live in the home
* Someone who is allowed to live in the home with the kinship child or youth because of a court order, when there is a supervision plan in place

### Provisional expedited license 

You must complete and submit an application for a provisional expedited license to DCYF or a child-placing agency. You can request an application if all of the following are true: 

* You’ve received a foster or kinship caregiver license within the last five years
* We did not deny or cancel your license, and you did not have an agreement to relinquish (give up) your license 
* You live in the same home where you last received your license 
* There are no additional household members since you last received a license 
* The same CPA that licensed or certified you last time will supervise your expedited kinship license 
* You and other people in your household have passed the required [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks)

If we decide you do not meet the requirements to get a provisional expedited license, you cannot appeal our decision. We’ll continue to work with you so you can become fully licensed to be a kinship caregiver.
