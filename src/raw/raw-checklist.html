This page explains the steps you need to take to keep a child or youth in your care. All kinship caregivers need to take these steps, whether you want to be licensed or not. 

If you complete these steps, you’ll meet most of the requirements for getting a kinship caregiver license. The license will give you monthly payments to reimburse you for the costs of caring for a child or youth (these are called [monthly foster care payments](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/resources/payments)).

After we place a kinship child or youth in your home, we’ll call you to ask if you want a temporary license (usually an “initial license”). The initial license lets kinship caregivers get payments more quickly, while you wait for the full license.

You do not need an initial license to get a full kinship license.

If you have a [voluntary placement](https://dcyf.wa.gov/4300-case-planning/4307-voluntary-placement-agreement), you are not eligible for kinship licensing. Voluntary placements happen **without** a court order or the involvement of Child Protective Services. They are short-term agreements between parents and DCYF.

### Consider your options

Begin with these two steps:

* **Decide whether to get licensed**. Getting licensed is optional. You’ll be completing most of the steps to get licensed as part of placement, so DCYF encourages you to get licensed.  
* **Decide who to work with**. Only DCYF offers the initial license. For the full kinship license you can work with DCYF, [](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library/LIC_0147)a [private or tribal child placing agency](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/cpas-and-tribal-cpas/) (CPA). A child placing agency can be a good choice if you want more ongoing support or an agency that reflects your culture. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}




You can change agencies even after you get a license. You’ll need to complete paperwork and an updated home study. Also, please review [special circumstances](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/licensing-special-circumstances/) to see if you need to follow specific policies or work with specific agencies for licensing.




{% endCallout %}

### Required steps for all kinship caregivers

Whether you get licensed or not, you’ll need to complete these steps (also known as “placement requirements”),[](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/) so the child or youth can remain in your care. These steps are also required for licensing.

#### When you’ll do this 

You may go through some steps of this process before we place the child or youth in your home. You may go through other steps after we’ve already placed the child or youth in your home (for example, in emergency placements). 

#### Steps to follow

* **Get fingerprinted for [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/)**. You and **each** member of your household age 18 and over need to be fingerprinted. Youth age 16 and over will need to be fingerprinted if they have lived out of state within the last three years. First, you’ll complete an online or paper form. Then, you’ll receive an email instructing you how to set up appointments. You need to complete these appointments within **10 days** of placement. 
* **Get a walkthrough of your home.** DCYF will check your home for major safety hazards. 
* Get fingerprinted for background checks. You and each member of your household age 18 and over need to be fingerprinted. Youth age 16 and over will need to be fingerprinted if they have lived out of state within the last three years. First, you’ll complete an online or paper form. Then, you’ll receive an email instructing you how to set up appointments. You need to complete these appointments within 10 days of the child or youth coming to live with you. Learn more about the background check process.
* Complete and submit your home study application. We’ll help you complete your home study application online. We’ll send you an email with instructions to access the application in the Washington Caregiver Application Portal (WA CAP).
* Meet with licensing workers for home study visits and interviews. Learn more about the home study process. Let your licensing worker know if you need help meeting a requirement. Your licensing worker will connect with you to:


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}




Washington DCYF is committed to keeping children with relatives or kin. They’ll work with you to understand background check results. In most cases, criminal records will not prevent licensing. Talk about your individual circumstances with your licensing worker. Learn about [crimes that may prevent DCYF from licensing you](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/secretaryslist.pdf).




{% endCallout %}

* **Complete and submit your application**. A licensing worker will help you complete your [home study](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/home-study-process/) application online. They will send you an email with instructions to access the Washington Caregiver Application Portal (WA CAP). WA CAP is part of Secure Access Washington (SAW). 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}





If you choose to get licensed and want more than one adult on the license, think about whose name you should list first. They’ll be the one receiving payments.





{% endCallout %}

* **Meet with licensing workers for home visits and interviews**. Let your licensing worker know if you need help meeting a requirement. Your licensing worker will connect with you to:

  * Complete interviews. At least one in person (others can be virtual). These can happen over multiple visits and be as long as two hours each. 
  * If there are two or more caregivers, complete:

    * At least one interview with the caregivers together
    * One interview with each caregiver individually
  * Interview **each** household member, including children. These are usually about 5-10 minutes long. Children must be interviewed in person.
  * Interview all adult children you've parented.
  * Complete the home inspection. Review the [inspection checklist](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=10-183&title=) to learn what licensing workers are looking for.

### How to get an initial (temporary)  license for monthly payments


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}

**Note:** If you’ve been licensed in Washington state in the last five years and need a temporary license, you may be eligible for a provisional expedited license. Contact DCYF for more information. For everyone else, follow these instructions to get an initial license.

{% endCallout %}

The initial license lets kinship caregivers get up to three months of foster care payments more quickly, while you complete the kinship licensing process. The initial license is good for 90 days. 

You can get an initial license even if you have not completed the home study process or fingerprinting yet.  

#### What to expect

**About two weeks after we place a kinship child or youth in your home,** our Licensing Division will call you to ask if you want an initial license. If you have not gotten a phone call after two weeks, ask the caseworker or tribal worker to connect you with DCYF’s Licensing Division.

**Within a few weeks of the phone call,** DCYF will send you a letter via email or mail confirming your initial license. 

**Once you have the initial license,** you’ll be eligible for monthly foster care payments for up to three months. At the end of each month, DCYF will send you an “invoice.” This is a credit that you need to claim to get your check. It takes about 45 days from placement to get your first check. Learn [how to get foster care payments](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/resources/payments/foster-care-payments).

**If we do not issue your full kinship license within 90 days of issuing your initial license,** your monthly payments will stop. Payments will continue when DCYF issues you the full kinship caregiver license. We will not remove the child from your care just because you took longer than 90 days to get a full license.

### How to get a full kinship license for monthly payments

When you complete the home study and fingerprinting to become a kinship caregiver, you’ll already be completing most of the steps to get a full kinship caregiver license. The only additional step for getting a full license is to agree to follow the [rules for kinship caregivers](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules). 

You do not need an initial license to get a kinship license.

#### What to expect 

When you complete the paperwork to become a kinship caregiver, you'll check a box that says you want a kinship caregiver license. 

Ideally, we’ll issue the kinship license about 3 months after the child or youth comes to live with you. 

If you’re approved, you’ll get your license via email or mail. Once DCYF approves your kinship license, you can get foster care payments. 

If we [deny](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-denials-suspensions-revocations) your application, we’ll let you know, and you’ll have the right to [appeal](https://dcyf.wa.gov/board-of-appeals). A denial does not mean we’ll remove the child or youth from your care.
