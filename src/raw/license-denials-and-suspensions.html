We’ll work with you before we deny, suspend, or cancel your kinship license. 

We may deny, suspend, or cancel a kinship license in the following situations: 

* You do not meet the licensing requirements. 
* People in your home or on your property have not passed a background check. 
* You did, allowed, or assisted in something illegal on the property of a home or facility that provides care to children or youth.  
* You give us false information on purpose, and it affects the safety and well-being of the kinship child or youth.
* You cannot support the safety, health, and well-being of the kinship child or youth.  
* You cannot or will not support a child's or youth's cultural needs, including their needs  based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation and gender identity, and expression (SOGIE).  
* We find that you abused, neglected, or abandoned a child or youth.  

If we decide to deny, suspend, or cancel your license, we’ll send you a certified letter to let you know. The letter will say what you can do if you disagree with our decision. 

DCYF makes decisions about: 

* Applicants for licenses
* Licenses we issue
* Licensed kinship caregivers
