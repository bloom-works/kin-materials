We’ll work with you before we deny, suspend, or revoke your kinship license. 

We may deny, suspend, or revoke a kinship license in the following situations: 

* You do not meet the [licensing requirements](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/license-requirements/). 
* People in your home or on your property have not passed a [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks). 
* You did, allowed, or assisted in something illegal on the property of a home or facility that provides care to children or youth.  
* You give us false information on purpose, and it affects the safety and well-being of the kinship child or youth.
* You cannot support the safety, health, and well-being of the kinship child or youth.  
* You cannot or will not support a child's or youth's cultural needs, including their needs based on their [race, ethnicity, religion](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/race-ethnicity-religion-and-culture/), or [sexual orientation and gender identity, and expression](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/lgbtq/).
* We find that you abused, neglected, or abandoned a child or youth.  

If we decide to deny, suspend, or revoke your license, we’ll send you a certified letter to let you know. If you disagree with our decision, you can follow the instructions in the letter to [appeal it](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/hearings-and-appeals). 

If you apply for a license, and we find that you cannot provide for the safety, health, and well-being of the kinship child or youth, we have the right to: 

* Deny your application
* Revoke your license if you have one
* Take other actions against you for not complying with rules for kinship caregivers
