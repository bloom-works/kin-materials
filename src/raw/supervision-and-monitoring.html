To protect your child and keep them safe, you must supervise them while also maintaining their right to privacy.

### Supervision

Make reasonable efforts to protect your child from abuse and neglect. This means protect your child from physical injury, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation. 

Provide and arrange for supervision that’s appropriate for your child based on their age and development. 

If your child’s caseworker or the child-placing agency provided a written supervision plan, follow it. 

### Your child’s right to privacy

Your child has a right to privacy. Do not look at their personal mail, or emails, or listen to their phone calls. The only exceptions are if your child’s caseworker asks you to monitor the child, or the court approves monitoring as part of your child’s case plan. 

### Video and audio recording

You may record your child’s childhood events. Examples include: 

* Birthdays
* Vacations
* Extracurricular activities
* The first day of school

You may use door or window alarms, or motion detectors in your home. 

You may only use video or audio monitoring for your child in your home if one of these is true: 

* Your child is younger than 4 years old
* Your child is sick or medically fragile 
* The child’s licensed health care provider directed you in written orders to record the actions of your child 
* A DCYF Licensing Division senior administrator approves the use of electronic monitoring devices
* The court approves the use of video or audio monitoring as part of your child’s case plan

Do not use video or audio monitoring for your child in any other situations.
