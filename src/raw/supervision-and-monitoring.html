To protect the child or youth in your care, you must supervise them while also maintaining their right to privacy.

### Right to privacy

The child or youth in your care has a right to privacy. Do not look at their text messages, direct messages on social media, personal mail, or emails, or listen to their phone calls. The only exceptions are if the caseworker asks you to monitor them, or the court approves monitoring as part of their case plan.

### Taking photos and videos

You’re allowed to record and take photos of the child or youth’s everyday activities. You can also record their childhood events.

### Home security

You’re allowed to use door or window alarms, doorbell security cameras, or motion detectors in your home.

### Video and audio monitoring

Video or audio monitoring is ongoing video or audio surveillance. You may only use video or audio monitoring in your home **if one of these is true:**

* The child is younger than 5 years old.
* They are sick or [medically fragile](https://dcyf.wa.gov/4517-health-care-services-children-placed-out-home-care/45171-medically-fragile-children).
* Their licensed health care provider directed you in written orders to record the child or youth.
* A DCYF Licensing Division senior administrator approves the use of electronic monitoring devices.
* The court approves the use of video or audio monitoring as part of the child or youth’s case plan. 

Do not use video or audio monitoring in any other situations. 

### Supervision

Make reasonable efforts to protect the child or youth from [abuse and neglect](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.44.020). This means protect them from physical injury, sexual abuse, and [sexual exploitation](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.44.020).

Provide and arrange for supervision that’s appropriate for them based on their age and development. Follow [our rules](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/prudent-parenting) for how to decide who can watch the child or youth, and what activities they can participate in. 

If the caseworker or the Child Placing Agency or tribal Child Placing Agency provided a written supervision plan, follow it.
