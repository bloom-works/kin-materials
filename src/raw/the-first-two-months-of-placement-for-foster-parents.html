## What to expect in the first 10 days of placement

In the first few days of placement, there’s a lot that happens. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed or confused. 

Here’s what to expect in the first 10 days of placement:

* **A caseworker will visit you and the child** **or youth** at home during their first week with you. This is called a Health and Safety Visit. The caseworker will check on how things are going. They’ll also spend some time alone with the child or youth to hear how they’re doing.
* **The child or youth will have family time visits** with their parents and siblings. It’s your responsibility to support the child or youth's connection to their parents and siblings. Follow the court and the caseworker's instructions about family time. Learn more about family time visits.
* **There will be a meeting within the first three days, if there was no  Family Team Decision-Making (FTDM) meeting before the child or youth came into your care**. This meeting is an opportunity to learn more about why the child or youth is in foster care. Their parents may have to agree for you to attend this meeting. We strongly encourage you to attend the meeting if possible. You may get invitations to other meetings about caring for the child or youth (also called shared planning meetings) depending on their situation. 

If Child Protective Services recently removed the child or youth from their parents, and this is child or youth’s first placement outside of their home, these things will also happen: 

* **There will be a court "shelter care hearing" within the first three days**. Read more about [what happens at a shelter care hearing](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library?combine_1=CWP_0065&combine=&field_program_topic_value=All&field_languages_available_value=All).
* **You’ll get an interim voucher** that allows you to access medical care for the child or youth while you wait for their medical insurance coverage card to arrive. You can also ask the caseworker to look up the child or youth's Provider One or Apple Health Core Connections identification number in DCYF’s system.
* **The state will mail you the child or youth’s medical insurance coverage card.**
