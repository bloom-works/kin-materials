## What to expect in the first 10 days of placement

In the first few days of placement, there’s a lot that happens. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed or confused. 

Here’s what to expect in the first 10 days of placement:

* **A caseworker will visit you and the child** **or youth** at home during their first week with you. This is called a Health and Safety Visit. The caseworker will check on how things are going. They’ll also spend some time alone with the child or youth to hear how they’re doing.
* **The child or youth will have family time visits** with their parents and siblings. It’s your responsibility to support the child or youth's connection to their parents and siblings. Follow the court and the caseworker's instructions about family time. Learn more about family time visits.
* **There will be a meeting within the first three days, if there was no  Family Team Decision-Making (FTDM) meeting before the child or youth came into your care**. This meeting is an opportunity to learn more about why the child or youth is in foster care. Their parents may have to agree for you to attend this meeting. We strongly encourage you to attend the meeting if possible. You may get invitations to other meetings about caring for the child or youth (also called shared planning meetings) depending on their situation. 

If Child Protective Services recently removed the child or youth from their parents, and this is child or youth’s first placement outside of their home, these things will also happen: 

* **There will be a court "shelter care hearing" within the first three days**. Read more about [what happens at a shelter care hearing](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library?combine_1=CWP_0065&combine=&field_program_topic_value=All&field_languages_available_value=All).
* **You’ll get an interim voucher** that allows you to access medical care for the child or youth while you wait for their medical insurance coverage card to arrive. You can also ask the caseworker to look up the child or youth's Provider One or Apple Health Core Connections identification number in DCYF’s system.
* **The state will mail you the child or youth’s medical insurance coverage card.**

## What you need to do

There are a few things you'll need to do after a child or youth is placed in your home.

### Education

* **Keep the child or youth enrolled in and attending the same school.** If you believe the child or youth should move to a new school, please talk with the caseworker. The child or youth can only change schools if you go through a “best interest determination” meeting. 
* **If a new school placement is approved, enroll the child or youth in a new school within three days.** 
* **Request copies of the child or youth’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP), or 504 Plan, if they have one.**
* If the student has outstanding school fees or fines, send the bills to the caseworker to pay them. 

If you need help, contact the caseworker or ask to speak with the [school district’s foster care liaison](https://ospi.k12.wa.us/student-success/accessopportunity-education/foster-care/foster-careliaisonsdcyf-contactsschool-contacts).

### Health care

* **Schedule a dental exam if the child or youth has one or more teeth.** Within the first 30 calendar days of placement, you must contact a dentist and make an appointment for an initial dental examination. The exam must occur within the first 60 days of placement.
* Schedule and take the child or youth to a medical appointment: 

  * If the child or youth has an urgent medical need, take them to urgent care or an emergency room within five days. 
  * If the child or youth has a medical need that is not urgent, take 
* Make any other medical appointments the child or youth needs: 

  *
* **Make sure you have the child or youth’s medications**. When the child or youth arrives at your home, the caseworker is responsible for giving you the medications they take. Bring the medications to the child or youth’s medical appointments. Use the interim voucher for medical care to get refills. You can use the same pharmacy, or use a different pharmacy. 
* **Talk with the caseworker first if you think the child or youth needs changes to their medications**. The caseworker needs to get permission before any changes to medications. 

**Record keeping**

* **Keep records that you receive for the child or youth, and maintain them** (also called a well-being file). Add this information to their file, if it’s not already there: 

  * The child or youth’s name and birth date
  * The names and phone numbers of the caseworker, guardian ad litem, child advocate, and attorney
  * Medical information, immunization records, and medication records 
  * Written consent for providing medical care and emergency surgery, as authorized by a court order
  * A list of the child or youth’s personal belongings. Keep this list updated with any items they get while they live with you.  
  * The names, addresses, and phone numbers of emergency contacts
  * The names, addresses, and phone numbers for people who are allowed to have unsupervised access to the child or youth 
  * Any specific cultural, social, and emotional needs that the child or youth has
* **Keep track of transportation expenses** on the [Caregiver Monthly Transportation Reimbursement form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=07-090&title=) and turn in complete forms to the caseworker to get reimbursed.
* **Sign up for DCYF's online portal for managing foster care payments, and submit your request for your first monthly payment**. Learn more about foster care payments.
