We’re required to perform background checks on you, and anyone who has unsupervised access to the child or youth. We do this to protect the child or youth’s health, safety, and wellbeing. 

### Who needs a background check

When you apply to become a kinship caregiver, we do background checks on all these people:

* You, the caregiver 
* Any adult who lives in your home, and who will regularly have unsupervised access to the child or youth
* Any adult who lives on your property, and who will regularly have unsupervised access to the child or youth
* Any youth age 16 or 17 who lives in your home, and who will regularly have unsupervised access to the child or youth
* Any youth age 16 or 17  who lives on your property, and who will regularly have unsupervised access to the child or youth

All of these people must agree to get a background check in order for us to approve your application to become a caregiver, or have a kinship caregiver license.  

If you're applying for an initial license, all household members age 16 and older must have a conditionally approved background check. 

The child or youth does not need a background check. 

We pay the costs of your background check if we've proposed the child or youth’s placement in your home.

### What a background check covers

We’re required to review any criminal convictions and pending criminal charges you may have. 

We may also review information from sources including, but not limited to: 

* Washington State Patrol
* Washington courts
* The state Department of Corrections
* The state Department of Health
* Civil adjudication proceedings
* Yourself
* Out-of-state law enforcement and court records
* Child protective services case files or other related information systems
* Administrative hearing decisions related to any DSHS or DCYF license that the state canceled, suspended, or denied

If you’re over the age of 18, we also:

* Review child abuse or neglect registries in each state where you’ve lived in the five years before the background check.
* Review Washington State Patrol and FBI fingerprint-based background checks regardless of how long you’ve lived in Washington state.
* Conduct a fingerprint-based background check if you’ve lived in the state less than three consecutive years before your application. 

#### If you have a conviction, negative action, or pending criminal charge 

You may still be able to become a caregiver or have a caregiver license even if you have certain criminal convictions, civil or administrative penalties (also called “negative actions”), or pending criminal charges on your record. 

For some criminal convictions, negative actions, or pending criminal charges, we’ll review other information about your character, suitability, and competence to make a decision on your application. 

We’ll consider these factors: 

* The amount of time since the conviction, negative action, or pending criminal charge
* The seriousness of the crime or incident that led to the conviction, negative action, or pending criminal charge
* The number, types, and age of other convictions, negative actions, or pending criminal charges on your records
* Your age at the time of the conviction, negative action, or pending criminal charge
* Whether you’ve completed rehabilitation programs since the conviction, negative action, or pending criminal charge

If you had a previous criminal conviction, it does not affect your application if:

* You received a pardon.
* A court expunged your record.
* A court vacated your conviction.

For the full list of criminal convictions and negative actions and how they may affect your eligibility to be a caregiver or have unsupervised access to children, visit the [Washington State Department of Social and Health Services’ Secretary's List of Crimes and Negative Actions for Employees and Providers](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/secretaryslist.pdf).

If you have a criminal conviction or negative action on the list that’s “permanently disqualifying” for child welfare, we cannot allow you to be a caregiver or to have unsupervised access to children.

If you have a criminal conviction or negative action on the list that’s “5 year disqualifying” for child welfare, and it’s been less than five years since your conviction or negative action, you are not eligible to be a caregiver or to have unsupervised access to children for five years.

#### If you’ve had a substantiated or “founded finding” of child abuse or neglect  

If you received a Certificate of Parental Improvement (CPI), we may still consider the facts of the situation that led to the finding to decide whether to grant you unsupervised access to children.

If you received a Certificate of Restoration of Opportunity (CROP), we’ll still see this finding on your record. 

### How we use your background check information 

We use the information from your background check to process your application. We will not share your information with any other organizations. 

### What happens after your background check 

If you're applying to become a caregiver or to get a caregiver license, and you pass a background check, we'll continue to process your application. We will not reach out to you specifically to let you know you passed your background check. 

If you’re applying for unsupervised access to a child and you pass a background check, we’ll let  you know directly. 

If you do not pass a background check, we’ll let you know directly, and explain why. 

If you want to appeal the department's decision, you can request an administrative hearing. You cannot appeal convictions, negative actions, or pending criminal charges in the administrative hearing.
