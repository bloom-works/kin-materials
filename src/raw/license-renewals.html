To renew your license, you must submit your renewal application before your current license expires. If we do not receive your application by the expiration date, we’ll close your kinship license. 

We’ll send you a notice to renew your license 90 days before your current license expires. 

Work with your licensor to complete the application process. You’ll need to: 

* Provide the required renewal documents. 
* Complete [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks) for everyone in your home who is age 16 or older.
* Complete [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks) for everyone who is age 16 or older who lives on your property and who has unsupervised access to the kinship child or youth. 
* Take part in a reassessment. 
* Take part in a home inspection.  
* In rare cases, take part in any further assessments we may need (e.g. a health assessment based on your physical health, mental health, or substance use history). 

If we approve your application, we’ll send you a new license.

### Additional assessments for license renewals

In rare situations, we may need you to complete additional assessments when you apply to renew your license. 

We may need you to complete additional assessments if the child or youth has safety or other specific needs related to, but not limited to, the following: 

* Your physical health
* Your mental health history
* Your substance use history

If you’re already getting treatment, counseling, or other support in these areas, we may want to speak to someone to confirm the support you’re getting.
