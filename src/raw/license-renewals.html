A kinship license lasts for 3 years. 

We’ll send you a notice to renew your license 90 days before your current license expires. 

To renew your license, you must submit your renewal application before your current license expires. We can help you to re-apply when you’re caring for a child or youth. If we do not receive your application by the expiration date, we’ll have to close your kinship license. 

Work with your licensor to complete the application process. You’ll need to: 

* Provide the required renewal documents online in the WA CAP portal.  
* Complete [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks) for everyone in your home who is age 16 or older.
* Complete [background checks](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks) for everyone who is age 16 or older who lives on your property and who has unsupervised access to the kinship child or youth. 
* Complete a renewal assessment (a DCYF worker will visit your home to talk about any changes in your home, family, or the child or youth’s needs). 
* In rare cases, complete any further assessments we may need (for example, a health assessment based on your physical health, mental health, or substance use history). If you get treatment, counseling, or other support in these areas, we may want to speak to someone to confirm the support you’re getting. 

If we approve your application, we’ll send you a new license. If we deny your application, it does not necessarily mean we’ll remove the child or youth from your care.
