To renew your license, you must submit your renewal application before your current license expires. If we do not receive your application by the expiration date, we’ll end your kinship caregiver license. 

We’ll send you a notice to renew your license 90 days before your current license expires. 

Work with your licensor to complete the application process. You’ll need to: 

* Provide the required renewal documents. 
* Complete background checks for everyone in your home and your property who has unsupervised access to your kinship child or youth. 
* Take part in a reassessment. 
* Take part in a home inspection.  
* In rare cases, take part in any further assessments we may need (e.g. a health assessment based on your mental health, or substance use history). 

If we approve your application, we’ll send you a new license.
