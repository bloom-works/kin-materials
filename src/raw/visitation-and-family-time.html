As a kinship caregiver, you need to make the child or youth available for visits with their parents, siblings, and other people who are involved in their care. 

### Family time

Family visits, also called “family time,” help the child or youth bond with their parents and siblings. They can help the child or youth heal from trauma. They can also help them cope with the emotional challenges of being away from their family. 

#### Scheduling

The court will create a plan for the child or youth’s family time with their parents and siblings. This will set a minimum amount of family time or number of visits for the child or youth. Make sure the child or youth is available for family time, according to the plan. The plan is different for every child or youth.

The exact times will depend on the child or youth’s family, and the workers arranging the visit. The child or youth and their family members should be able to get together in a way that works for them, and you as the caregiver. 

#### Your role in family time

You do not have to go to family time as a caregiver. 

You may be asked to supervise visits. You’re welcome to do it, if it feels comfortable and appropriate for you to do so. At any time, you can change your mind about supervising, if it’s not working for you. DCYF has visitation supervisors. 

If you have concerns about safety or something else related to family time, tell the caseworker and the child advocate (like the [CASA worker](https://nationalcasagal.org/our-work/the-casa-gal-model/) or “[guardian ad litem](https://www.washingtonlawhelp.org/en/guardian-ad-litem-gal-guide),” also known as GAL). When the child or youth has a court hearing or review coming up, write down your concerns in the [Caregiver's Report to the Court form](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/node/4249).  

#### Transportation to or from family time

DCYF is responsible for arranging the child or youth’s transportation to and from family time. You can also ask for the child or youth to be picked up from or dropped off to you somewhere that’s not your home. 

Or if you’d like to transport the child or youth yourself, you can ask us to [reimburse you for mileage](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/resources/payments/get-paid-back). 

#### Other relatives that are not parents or siblings

If other relatives want to visit the child or youth for less than 72 hours, use [prudent parenting standards](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/rules/prudent-parenting) to decide if that’s okay. As long as you think it’s safe and the court does not ban visits with the relative, we encourage the child or youth to have connections with other relatives. 

### Caseworkers

You need to make the child or youth available for a monthly visit with the caseworker. This will usually happen at your home. You also need to have regular contact with the caseworker to let them know how the child or youth is doing. 

### Other people who need to speak to or visit the child or youth

Some people play a legal role in planning and managing the child or youth’s care. These people must be able to talk to, or visit the child or youth, including at your home and property.

You need to make the child or youth available for conversations and visits with: 

* DCYF workers
* Representatives from the Child Placing Agency and tribal Child Placing Agency
* Representatives from their tribe
* Their [guardian ad litem (GAL)](https://www.washingtonlawhelp.org/en/guardian-ad-litem-gal-guide)
* Their [court appointed special advocate (CASA worker)](https://nationalcasagal.org/our-work/the-casa-gal-model/)
* Their attorney
