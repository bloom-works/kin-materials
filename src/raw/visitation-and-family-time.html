You need to make the child or youth in your care available for visits with their family, and other people who are planning or managing their care.

### Family visits

Family visits, also called “Family Time,” help maintain the child or youth’s bond with their family. They can also help them cope with the emotional challenges of being away from their family.

Make sure the child or youth has visiting time with their family members, including siblings, according to their case plan. 

### Other people who need to speak to or visit the child or youth

Some people play a legal role in planning and managing the child or youth’s care. These people must be able to talk to, or visit the child or youth, including at your home and property.

You need to make the child or youth available for conversations and visits with: 

* Caseworkers.
* DCYF workers.
* Representatives from the placing agency.
* Representatives from their tribe.
* Their guardian ad litem (GAL).
* Their court appointed special advocate (CASA).
* Their attorney.
