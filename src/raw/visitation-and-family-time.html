As a caregiver, you need to make your kin child available for visits with their birth family and with those supporting them during this time.

### Family visits

Family visits can help maintain your kin child’s bond with their birth family. They can also help them cope with the emotional challenges of being away from their birth family. 

Make sure your kin child has visiting time with their family members, including siblings, according to their case plan. 

### Support visits

Many people play a part in planning and supporting your kin child’s wellbeing while they are under your care. You need to make sure they are able to visit at any time, including at your home and property.

You may need to make your kin child available for visits from: 

* DCYF workers
* Representatives from the child-placing agency
* Representatives from your child’s tribe
* Your child’s guardian ad litem (GAL)
* Your child’s court appointed special advocate (CASA)
* Your child’s attorney
