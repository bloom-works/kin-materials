Family visits can help preserve your child’s bond with their birth family. It can also help your child cope with the emotional challenges of being separated from their birth family. 

Make your child available for time with their family members and visits with their siblings, according to their case plan. 

Allow people who are involved in planning and supporting your child’s wellbeing to meet with your child. These people should be able to meet with your child at any time, including at your home and property: 

* DCYF workers
* Representatives from the child-placing agency
* Representatives from your child’s tribe
* Your child’s guardian ad litem (GAL)
* Your child’s court appointed special advocate (CASA)
* Your child’s attorney
