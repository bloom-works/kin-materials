### Situations that require reassessments 

We need to do a reassessment in these situations: 

* You already have a kinship caregiver license, and you want to add another child or youth to it
* You need to add or remove caregivers from your kinship caregiver license
* You want to apply for a foster home license

### Situations that require home inspections

We need to do a home inspection within 30 days of one of these events: 

* You’re a licensed kinship caregiver to a child or youth, and you spend your first night in a new home 
* You let us know that you’ve moved, if you are not taking care of a child or youth right now 

### If you’re an employee of DCYF 

If you work for DCYF, and you’re applying for a kinship caregiver license, you must follow department policies for getting a license. 

### If you work for a child-placing agency

Your employer cannot certify you to provide kinship or foster care, if you work in one of these areas: 

* Administration
* Supervision
* Foster or kinship home certification
* Placement
* Payment authorization
* Case management 

If a child-placing agency certified you, and you later start working for the same agency in one of the roles listed above, you must either: 

* Get recertified through another child-placing agency within 6 months of starting your job
* Become licensed directly by DCYF within 6 months of starting your job

### If you have financial ties to a child-placing agency

The child-placing agency you have financial ties to cannot license or certify you to provide kinship or foster care.

### If you want or have multiple licenses, certifications, or authorizations

If you have a kinship caregiver license, you may also apply for a license to provide child care services to your community. If you’re applying for more than 1 type of license, you must submit a complete application for each license type. 

We’ll conduct a separate assessment at your home for each type of license you apply for. 

We may approve your requests for more than one type of DCYF license if both of these are true: 

* There are multiple licensed kinship caregivers living at your home or address. 
* Each licensed kinship caregiver is licensed to care for a different child or youth.

If we find that you are not complying with requirements and regulations for your licenses:

* We can mutually agree to change one or more of the licenses, certifications, or authorizations.
* You can voluntarily agree to give up 1 or more of the licenses, certifications, or authorizations. 
* We may fine you. 
* We may suspend, deny, modify, or cancel 1 or more of the licenses.

#### If you have a kinship caregiver license and a child care license

You must follow the rules for both license types. 

For example, you must follow the rules for licensed kinship caregivers, and also: 

* Develop and follow individual care plans for every child or youth in your care who has developmental, health, or behavioral needs.
* If you’re allowed to provide overnight care, follow the rules for overnight care. 

### Additional assessments for license renewals

In rare situations, we may need you to complete additional assessments when you apply to renew your license. 

We may need you to complete additional assessments if your child has specific needs related to issues including, but not limited to: 

* Mental health
* Substance use
* Collaterals
