Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) is a specialized type of short-term foster care in Washington state. 

TFC parents care for children and youth with complex mental and behavioral health needs. To provide TFC, you must be a licensed foster parent, and get an additional certification for TFC by a Child Placing Agency (CPA). 

If you provide TFC, you get extra training and ongoing support to care for children and youth. You’ll also get a stipend to provide TFC. 

## How TFC works 

We refer children and youth who need additional behavioral and therapeutic services to participate in TFC. The program is meant to provide children and youth with support and services, help them develop independent living skills, and support their transition to less restrictive, permanent settings.

As a foster parent who provides TFC, you’re responsible for: 

* Providing day-to-day support supervision and behavioral feedback to the child or youth, according to their individual treatment plan
* Meeting with the child or youth and their family (also called the Child and Family team) every month. This is a space to share feedback, and talk about the child or youth’s strengths, needs, and treatment goals.
* Actively working with the Child and Family team to identify solutions to challenges facing the child or youth
* Helping develop a plan for, and supporting the child’s or youth’s transition to a permanent home

We may also ask you to speak about your experience with the child or youth during case staffing and counseling sessions with them or their family. 

## Requirements to provide TFC

You’ll need to meet these requirements: 

* You must get a license to be a foster parent. Learn how to get a foster care license (add link).
* In addition to having a foster care license, you must get certified to provide TFC by a participating CPA. 
* You must provide children and youth with a higher level of support to meet their therapeutic needs.
* You must complete 30 hours of training every year. The CPA will provide the training based on the needs of each TFC parent, and the issues of the children and youth they care for. The training generally focuses on providing culturally responsive, trauma informed, and LGBTQIA+ affirming care.  

## Compensation for TFC parents

Foster parents who provide TFC get payments, separate from monthly foster care maintenance payments. 

TFC parents get payments from their CPA. The payments range based on the needs of the children or youth in your home, and level of care you provide.
