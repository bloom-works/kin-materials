Provide care that respects your child’s sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression (SOGIE). Your care should be appropriate for your child based on their emotional and developmental needs.

Create a supportive and affirming environment for your child at home and in your community.

Use your child’s preferred pronouns and name.

Do not share their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression without their permission.

Share relevant resources with them so they can get more support.
