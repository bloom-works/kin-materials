LGBTQ+ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer, and other sexual orientations and gender identities. As a kinship caregiver, you must provide care that respects and supports the sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression of the child or youth in your care.

This includes:

* Creating a supportive and affirming environment for them at home, in school, and in the community around the child or youth. For example, providing health care and clothing that matches the child or youth’s gender identity.
* Using their pronouns and chosen name.
* Not sharing their sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression without their permission.
* Sharing support resources and opportunities that the child or youth can explore on their own.

Consider learning more about how to support LGBTQ+ children and youth. For example, you can: 

* Read, watch, or listen to materials about how to support LGBTQ+ children and youth.
* Sign up for [training about how to support LGBTQ+ children and youth](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses/content/lgbtqia-basics-supporting-youth-elearning). 
* Meet other caregivers or families who care for LGBTQ+ children or youth.
* Go to counseling for yourself or for your family to learn how to support the child or youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
