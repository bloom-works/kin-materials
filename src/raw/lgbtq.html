You must provide care that respects your kin child’s sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression (SOGIE). 

This includes:

* Creating a supportive environment for your kin child at home and in your community
* Using their preferred pronouns and name
* Not sharing their SOGIE without their permission 
* Sharing relevant resources with them so they can get more support

You will need to adjust your care based on your kin child's emotional and developmental needs.
