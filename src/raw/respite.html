Respite care is temporary care that allows you to take a break from parenting and caregiving. It is an important resource for kinship caregivers. This page describes the rules for using respite care services. 

### If you want respite care

You can get respite care for the child or youth either inside your home or somewhere else. 

If you want respite care in your home, you can identify people outside of your household to be respite care providers for the child or youth. They’ll need to apply to DCYF to become a paid respite care provider, if they are not already. 

If you want respite care outside of your home, you can do any of the following: 

* Identify people who can serve as paid respite care providers in their homes. 
* Ask DCYF or your child-placing agency for foster homes that provide respite care. 
* Contact the child or youth's caseworker for tribal certified respite homes.

If you want occasional respite care for less than 72 hours at a time (e.g. babysitting while you run errands), use [prudent parenting standards](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/prudent-parenting/) to make arrangements. 

If you want respite care on a regular basis, or for more than 72 hours at a time, you’ll need to get approval from the child or youth’s caseworker. 

### Requirements for paid respite care providers 

After you’ve identified people who you want to serve as respite care providers, they must complete: 

* An application
* An FBI fingerprint-based background check
* At least one interview
* An infant safety agreement

If someone wants to provide respite care for the child or youth in their own home, a licensor must also do a [walkthrough of their home](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/home-study-process/). Everyone in their home or on their property who is age 16 and older who will have unsupervised access to the child or youth must also pass a [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/). 

After they complete the application process, they can get payments from us when they provide respite care. 

### If you want to provide respite care in your home 

If you’re a licensed kinship caregiver, you can also provide respite care in your home for other children or youth who have kinship caregivers. 

If you'd like to be eligible to get paid for providing respite care, request a reassessment to add the other children or youth to your license.
