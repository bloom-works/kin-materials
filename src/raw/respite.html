It’s important for caregivers to have breaks from caregiving. There are several ways you can take breaks from caregiving.  


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}

Talk to your caseworker or licensor for a detailed explanation of all the available options for getting temporary care for the child or youth.

{% endCallout %}

### When you want someone to come into your home to watch the child or youth

**For occasional, temporary care for less than 72 hours**

You can have someone you trust (e.g. a babysitter) come and care for the child. 

**For temporary care for more than 72 hours, or regularly occurring** 

You can either: 

* Identify someone you trust to temporarily care for the child or youth. 

  * If you do not need DCYF to pay them, your caseworker will need to run a [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/) on this person, before they can care for the child or youth. 
  * If you need DCYF to pay them, they can become kinship certified respite providers. They’ll need to complete the [certification process](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/temporarily-caring-for-the-child-or-youth-if-you-are-not-the-kinship-caregiver/). 
* Ask DCYF to identify a certified respite provider to come to your home and care for the child or youth. There is no guarantee that DCYF will be able to find someone.

### When you want the child or youth to go to someone who will watch them outside of your home

The child or youth can temporarily stay at one of these places: 

* A licensed child care facility 
* A licensed foster home 
* A licensed kinship home who is approved to care for the child or youth
* The home of another kin (relative or family friend) of the child or youth you trust to temporarily care for the child or youth. 

  * If you do not need DCYF to pay them, your caseworker will need to run a [background check](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/background-checks/) on this person, their household members, and complete [a walkthrough of the home](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/home-conditions/) before they can care for the child or youth. 
  * If you need DCYF to pay them, they can become kinship certified respite providers. They’ll need to complete the [certification process](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/temporarily-caring-for-the-child-or-youth-if-you-are-not-the-kinship-caregiver/).
