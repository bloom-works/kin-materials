Before a child or youth comes to live with you, a licensing worker comes to your home and completes a home study. A home study is the process we use to get to know you, and help you prepare to meet the needs of children and youth. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
We’ll try to work with you, and support you to complete the home study process. Caregivers come from all racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. They’re renters and homeowners, and people with different sexual orientations, and any education level. You can be single, partnered, or married.
{% endCallout %}

## Caregiver questions

We'll talk with you to learn about you and your household, your plan to care for children and youth, and how we offer support. These conversations can happen over multiple visits, and they can be as long as two hours each. At least one of these conversations will be in person.

Our goal is to make sure you have the support and resources to meet the needs of children and youth.

We’ll ask you about:

* The people in your household
* How the placement of foster children and youth will change your life
* Your plan to meet children and youth’s health, education, and cultural or religious needs
* How your physical and mental health, substance use, and relationships may affect your ability to care for children and youth
* Guiding children and youth’s behavior including positive discipline
* How your occupation, work schedule, and financial situation may affect your ability to care for children and youth
* Resources you have, or will need, to support children and youth
* If you’re willing and able to care for children and youth long term 

We’ll interview the other people in your household, including children. These conversations can be as short as 5-10 minutes long. We must talk with children in person.

We’ll also interview all adult children you've parented, even if they do not live with you. These conversations are usually over the phone.

## Physical safety questions

We’ll walk through your home. We’ll check if your home meets the home condition requirements for foster care licensing. We use the [home inspection checklist](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/forms?field_number_value=10-183&title=) to identify any changes you need to make or items you need to get.

We’ll also discuss your role in ensuring the health and safety of children and youth. Learn more about the roles and responsibilities of foster parents \[add link].

We’ll talk with you about:

* Health and medicine
* Weapons at home
* Drugs and alcohol at home
* Transportation for children and youth
* Home conditions, including:
* * Basic home safety

  * Outdoor spaces

  * Sleeping spaces

  * Toxic substances

  * Emergency preparedness


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
If you already have a foster care license, you need to let us know about certain changes in your home or household \[add link]. We’ll need to update your home study or do a new home study.
