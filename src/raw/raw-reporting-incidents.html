You need to report serious incidents involving your child to DCYF.

To report a serious incident, call the child’s caseworker. If the child's or youth's caseworker is not available, or it is after normal business hours, call department intake at [1-800-301-1868](tel:+18003011868). 

If you do not report these events, DCYF will send you a notice of violation. If the violation results in harm, CPS may also open an investigation.

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}The reporting time frames listed on this page are meant to give you time to respond to the situation first. **If you need help during an active emergency, call [911](tel:+911)**.{% endCallout %}

### Abuse, harm, or death
