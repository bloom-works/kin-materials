You need to report serious health and safety incidents involving your child to DCYF.

If the child or youth is an enrolled member of a tribe, or eligible to become an enrolled member, you also need to report incidents to the tribe. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}

The reporting time frames listed on this page are meant to give you time to respond to the situation first. **If you need help during an active emergency, call [911](tel:+911)**.

{% endCallout %}

### Abuse, harm, or death

**Immediately** contact the department intake at [1-866-363-4276](tel:+18663634276) if your child:

* Dies or is near death
* Has been [physically or sexually abused, neglected, or exploited](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.44.020) (or if you suspect they have been)
* Has had sexual contact with another child or youth that is not consensual or age or developmentally appropriate

### Physical restraint

**Within 24 hours**, report behavior that [resulted in physical restraint](https://dcyf-kin-materials.netlify.app/raw/discipline-and-restraint) to your child’s caseworker. This includes restraining a child to save them from harm. 

If you're not sure what physical restraint is, talk to the caseworker. 

If you don't have your caseworker's contact information, [search our directory](https://apps-ca-ext.dcyf.wa.gov/EmployeeDirectoryInternet/).

If the caseworker is not available or it is after normal business hours, call department intake at [1-866-363-4276](tel:+18663634276).

### Medical emergencies

**Within 48 hours**, report medical emergencies to your child’s caseworker. Examples include:

* Medication given or taken wrong
* Serious illness or injury (for example, the child or youth went to the hospital, they broke a bone, or they needed stitches)
* Disclosed suicidal or homicidal thoughts, gestures, or attempts 
* Emergency medical treatment
* Emergency psychiatric care

If you don't have the caseworker's contact information, [search our directory](https://apps-ca-ext.dcyf.wa.gov/EmployeeDirectoryInternet/).

If the caseworker is not available or it is after normal business hours, call department intake at [1-866-363-4276](tel:+18663634276).


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}

You may experience a long wait time when you call department intake. If possible, we recommend you have a close relative or friend wait on the phone while you respond to the child or youth’s medical emergency.
