You need to report certain events to DCYF within specific timeframes. This allows DCYF to offer support or contact necessary authorities. 

To report a serious incident, contact the child’s caseworker or call the department intake at [1-800-301-1868](tel:+18003011868). 

{% Callout "note" %}If you do not report these events, DCYF will send you a notice of violation. If the violation results in harm, CPS may also open an investigation.{% endCallout %}
