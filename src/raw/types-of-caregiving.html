We encourage you to think about foster care as a system of support for families. As a caregiver, you are part of this support network and can make a difference in the lives of young people and their parents, too.

There are several ways to be a caregiver for a child or youth:

* Kinship caregiving
* Foster parenting, including Therapeutic Foster Care
* Voluntary placement agreement (VPA)
* Respite care

Guardianship and adoption are more permanent kinds of caregiving that happen outside the foster care system. Learn more about guardianship and adoption. \[add link]

## Kinship caregiving

We use the term "kinship care" to refer to the full-time care of a child by relatives and suitable others. "Suitable others" refers to unrelated kin or close family friends. While often provided by grandparents, kinship care includes many other relationships, such as adult siblings, "bonus" aunties and uncles, neighbors, and more.

If you’re caring for a child who is related to you or who you knew before you became their caregiver, you are likely a kinship caregiver. 

Kinship caregivers can get licensed to receive monthly payments. Kinship caregivers who get licensed receive the greatest amount of ongoing financial assistance DCYF can provide. Other benefits of getting licensed are:

* An assigned Licensing Division worker who can help with questions
* Access to the [Foster Parent Reimbursement and Liability Plan](https://dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library?combine_1=&combine=reimbursement&field_program_topic_2_value=All&field_languages_available_value=All) for unexpected damages
* Monthly foster care reimbursement for young adults over 18 who choose to participate in [Extended Foster Care](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-youth/extended-foster-care-program)

### DCYF’s kin-first culture

DCYF believes that kinship caregivers are the best option when a child or youth cannot live with their parents. More than half of all children and youth experiencing foster care are cared for by a kinship caregiver.

Children and youth who experience foster care are often removed from their homes, neighborhoods, communities, schools, pets, and friends. They also frequently lose connections with extended family and the traditions, language, and history maintained and passed on by these relationships.

We know that when children are placed with kin, they are more likely to maintain these connections and culture and experience more stability (compared to children in foster care). Research shows that benefits of kinship care can include:

* Less time spent in foster care
* Higher placement stability
* Lower chance of experiencing abuse by a caregiver
* Greater likelihood of staying connected to their extended family and keeping ties to their cultures, backgrounds, and customs, which is critical to their well-being
* Better behavioral and mental health outcomes

These are all reasons why DCYF is committed to a "kin-first" culture that places young people experiencing foster care with relatives and close family friends first!

## Foster parenting

The main goal of foster care is to provide safe, loving, temporary homes. As a foster parent, you take care of a child until they can be placed with kin, reunited with their parents, or reach permanency through guardianship or adoption. Foster parents help keep children connected to their families, schools, communities, and cultures.

The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) is looking for foster parents who:

* Know that foster care is temporary
* Believe children and families can grow 
* Value sibling relationships and keeping siblings together
* Come from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds
* Support LGBTQIA+ children and youth
* Want to support the child or youth’s connections with their family, school, community, and culture
* Want to care for children and youth with complex medical needs  

Foster parents must be licensed before caring for children. As a foster parent, you receive free training and monthly payments that reimburse you for the care you provide.

Our priority is to reunite children and youth with their parents. When reunification is not possible, we look for kin who can take care of the child. Guardianship and adoption by foster parents are only options for children and youth who cannot return to their parents and do not have any kin available to care for them. 

People who want to adopt Washington state foster children or youth must become fully licensed as foster parents. \[add link]

DCYF does not complete adoption-only home studies. Working with a private adoption agency may be a better fit for your family if you are not open to maintaining family connections or are not open to caring for a child with special needs.

### Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC)

Therapeutic Foster Care (PTFC) is a specialized form of foster care for young people with complex mental and behavioral health needs. 

Caregivers must be certified to provide TFC. Getting certified requires extra training to make sure you’re prepared to support children and youth who need therapeutic services, and their families.

As a caregiver through TFC, you receive additional payments and ongoing training.

Professional Therapeutic Foster Care is another form of TFC that is currently in development.

Learn more about TFC and how to get certified. \[add link]

## Voluntary placement agreement (VPA)

Voluntary placement agreements (VPAs) are short-term caregiving arrangements that happen without a court order. 

Instead, they happen when a child or youth’s parents voluntarily agree to have the child temporarily live with another caregiver. Most VPAs last up to 90 days.

If you are a caregiver in a voluntary placement, you cannot become a licensed kinship caregiver. Because the child or youth is not in DCYF’s care, you do not receive payments and you are not eligible for guardianship assistance program subsidies.

## Respite care

Respite is short-term care for children and youth in foster care. It gives full-time caregivers a chance to take a break and avoid getting burned out.

Respite care can happen in the child or youth’s full-time home or, in some cases, in the respite care provider’s home. To provide respite care, you need to be at least one of the following:

* A licensed foster parent
* A kinship caregiver
* A licensed child care provider
* Certified to provide respite care 

If you are licensed or certified, you can get a small daily stipend for providing respite care.
