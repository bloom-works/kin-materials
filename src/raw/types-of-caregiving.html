We encourage you to think about foster care as a system of support for families. As a caregiver, you are part of this support network and can make a difference in the lives of young people and their parents, too.

There are several ways to be a caregiver for a child or youth:

* Kinship caregiving
* Foster parenting, including Professional Therapeutic Foster Care
* Voluntary placement
* Respite care

## Kinship caregiving

We use the term "kinship care" to refer to the full-time care of a child by relatives and suitable others. "Suitable others" refers to unrelated kin or close family friends. While often provided by grandparents, kinship care includes many other relationships, such as adult siblings, "bonus" aunties and uncles, neighbors, and more.

If you’re caring for a child who is related to you or who you knew before you became their caregiver, you are likely a kinship caregiver. 

Kinship caregivers can get licensed to receive monthly payments. Kinship caregivers who get licensed receive the greatest amount of ongoing financial assistance DCYF can provide. Other benefits of getting licensed include:

* An assigned Licensing Division worker who can help with questions
* Access to the [Foster Parent Reimbursement and Liability Plan](https://dcyf.wa.gov/publications-library?combine_1=&combine=reimbursement&field_program_topic_2_value=All&field_languages_available_value=All) for unexpected damages
* Monthly foster care reimbursement for young adults over 18 who choose to remain in [Extended Foster Care](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-youth/extended-foster-care-program)

### DCYF’s kin-first culture

DCYF believes that kinship caregivers (including relatives and close family friends) are the best option when a child or youth cannot live with their parent(s). In fact, more than half of all children and youth experiencing foster care are cared for by a kinship caregiver such as a relative or close family friend.

Children and youth who experience foster care are often removed from their homes, neighborhood, school, pets, and friends.  They also frequently lose their relationships with extended family and the traditions, language, and history maintained and passed on by these relationships.

We know that when children are placed with kin, they are more likely to maintain these connections and culture and experience more stability (compared to children in general foster care). Research shows that some of the benefits of kinship care include the following:

* Less time spent in foster care
* Higher placement stability
* Lower probability of experiencing abuse by a caregiver
* Greater likelihood of staying connected to their extended family and keeping ties to their cultures, backgrounds, and customs, which is critical to their well-being
* Better behavioral and mental health outcomes

These are all reasons why DCYF is committed to a "kin-first" culture that places young people experiencing foster care with relatives and close family friends first!

## Foster parenting

The main goal of foster care is to reunite a child with their parents if possible. As a foster parent, you take care of a child until they can be reunited with their parents or adopted. 

Being a foster parent means providing a safe, loving, temporary home. Foster parents help keep children connected to their families, schools, communities, and cultures.

The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) is looking for foster parents who:

* Value sibling relationships and keeping siblings together
* Come from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds
* Affirm LGBTQIA+ children and youth
* Know that foster care is temporary
* Want to support the child or youth’s connections with their biological family and other people in their community
* Want to care for children and youth with complex medical needs  

Foster parents have to be licensed before caring for children. As a foster parent, you receive free training and monthly payments.

Washington requires adoptive parents to be fully licensed as foster parents.

Our top priority is to reunite children and youth with their parents. When reunification is not possible, we look for other kin who can take care of the child. Guardianship and adoption are only options for children and youth who cannot return to their parents and do not have relatives available to care for them.

If you want to adopt a young child (ages 0 to 5) and you’re not open to maintaining family connections or caring for a child with unique needs, we strongly encourage you to explore a private adoption instead.

### Professional Therapeutic Foster Care (PTFC)

Professional Therapeutic Foster Care (PTFC) is a specialized form of foster care for young people with complex mental health needs. 

Caregivers must be certified to provide PTFC. Getting certified requires extensive training to make sure you’re prepared to provide therapeutic support to children and their families.

As a caregiver through PTFC, you receive a living wage and ongoing coaching.

Learn more about PTFC and how to get certified.

## Voluntary placement

Voluntary placements are short-term caregiving arrangements that happen without a court order. They are also known as “kinship diversion.” 

Child protective services are not involved in voluntary placements. Instead, they happen when a child’s parents voluntarily agree to have the child temporarily live with another caregiver. The agreement lasts for up to 90 days.

If you are a caregiver in a voluntary placement, you do not need to be licensed and do not receive payments.

## Respite care

Respite is short-term care for children and youth in foster care. It gives full-time caregivers a chance to take a break and avoid getting burned out.

Respite care can happen in the child’s full-time home or in the respite care provider’s home. To provide respite care, you need to be at least one of the following:

* A licensed foster parent or kinship caregiver.
* A licensed child care provider.
* Certified to provide respite care. 
* Approved by the child’s caseworker.

If you are licensed or certified, you can get a small daily stipend for providing respite care.
