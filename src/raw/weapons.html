Examples of weapons include: 

* Guns
* Ammunition
* BB guns
* Pellet guns
* Air rifles
* Stun guns
* Archery equipment
* Other items designed to cause bodily harm or physical damage

If there’s a risk the child or youth may use other items to hurt themselves or other people, talk to the caseworker about how to secure those items in your home.
