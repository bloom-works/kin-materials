You’ll need to meet with your child’s caseworkers to make a plan to provide for your child’s basic needs, as well as any specific needs your child may have. 

For example, you need to provide food that meets your child’s specific dietary needs. This means food that avoids allergies the child may have, and food that suits their cultural preferences.

You also need to provide seasonally appropriate clothes for your child.
