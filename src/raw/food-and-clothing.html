You must provide basic needs, including food and clothing, for the child or youth in your care. Work with their caseworker to make a plan.

For example, you need to provide food that meets their specific dietary needs. Depending on their needs, you may need to consider:

* Food allergies
* Cultural restrictions

You also need to provide seasonally appropriate clothes for the child or youth.
