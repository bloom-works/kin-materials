You must provide basic needs, including food and clothing, for the child or youth in your care. Work with the caseworker to make a plan.

For example, you need to provide food that meets their specific dietary needs. Depending on their needs, you may need to consider:

* Food allergies
* Cultural restrictions

You also need to provide seasonally appropriate clothes for the child or youth.

It’s important for caregivers to be aware that children or youth who have experienced trauma may have increased sensory needs, like wanting or avoiding certain foods, and textures.
