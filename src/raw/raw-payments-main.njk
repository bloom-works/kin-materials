You have several options for financial support in your role as a caregiver.

### Financial support for rent, utilities, gas, and groceries 

DCYF may provide assistance with rent, utilities, or gas. Ask your child’s caseworker for help covering these costs as soon as possible. Once you become licensed, you’re no longer eligible for these sources of support. 

**Clothing vouchers**

DCYF may provide clothing vouchers for the child. Ask your child’s caseworker about these vouchers. 

### Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) supports families with children experiencing low income. TANF is a cash assistance program administered by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS).

As a kinship caregiver, you may be eligible for [non-needy relative TANF](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/esa/community-services-offices/non-needy-relative-loco-parentis-and-legal-guardian-grant). It’s sometimes called “child-only” TANF because applications do not consider your income.  

{% Callout %}You may be asked about your income on the non-needy relative TANF application. This is to find out if you qualify for other benefits programs.{% endCallout %}  

DCYF encourages you to apply for non-needy relative TANF to get financial support during the licensing process.

</ul>

{% Callout %}Caregivers cannot receive both TANF benefits and [foster care payments](#foster-care-payments). Foster care payments are higher than non-needy TANF.{% endCallout %} 

{% Callout "warning" %}If you receive TANF benefits, you must inform DSHS when you start getting foster care payments. You must report this by the 10th of the month after you get your first foster care payment. If you don’t, you may get an overpayment. You may have to pay back this overpayment.{% endCallout %}

### Foster care payments

You can decide if you want to become licensed. As a licensed caregiver, you can get monthly foster care payments. You can get these while you’re caring for a child placed by DCYF, a Tribe, or other jurisdiction. 

These payments have lots of different names:

* Foster care maintenance payments (FCMPs)  
* Foster care reimbursements  
* Caregiver support resource level payments

Foster care payments reimburse you for the cost of: 

* Food  
* Clothing  
* Shelter  
* Other caregiving expenses

Payments are sent the following month. For example, if you have a child in your care in May, you’ll get payment for that care in June. Learn [how to get payments](./payments-how/). 

{% Callout %}Foster care maintenance payments are reimbursements and not income. You should not report them as income to the IRS. They should not affect your taxes but may affect your eligibility for benefits.{% endCallout %}

### Mileage or transportation reimbursements 

DCYF reimburses mileage or transportation costs for some activities including: 

* Family time visits with parents or siblings  
* School or extracurricular activities    
* Court hearings and court-ordered activities   
* Medical, dental, counseling, or WIC appointments  
* Attendance at meetings at the request of DCYF staff   
* Some DCYF-approved caregiver trainings  
* Participation in recreational activities, practices, or lessons   
* Respite care, for mileage more than 10 miles each way   
* Child care, for mileage more than the caregiver’s regular commute to work

Ask your child’s caseworker if you are not sure whether an activity is approved. If an approved appointment or activity is longer than 3 hours, DCYF will reimburse you to drop them off and pick them up later. 

To claim your reimbursement, complete the following form and submit it to your child’s caseworker:

### Property damage and emergency medical care reimbursement 

DYCF provides [limited reimbursement](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pubs/FB_0011.pdf) for property damage and emergency medical care caused by a child. In some cases DCYF covers the result of your actions. Complete the appropriate form and submit it to your child's caseworker.
