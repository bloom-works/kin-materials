Learn how to claim your invoices onle using the Social Service Payment System (SSPS) Provider Portal. 

{% Callout "note", "undefined" %}If you claim an invoice online, do not claim the same invoice by mail or phone. This will cause payment issues and delays. {% endCallout %}

### Sign up for the SSPS Provider Portal

To claim invoices online, you’ll need to sign in to the SSPS Provider Portal.

If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create one. [Learn how to sign up for the SSPS Provider Portal](./payments-ssps.html).

### Claim your invoices

You can claim unclaimed invoices for the current month and the past 6 months using the SSPS Provider Portal. Claiming an invoice online will not affect how fast you’ll get your payment.

To claim your invoice online:

1. Select **Claims** from the main menu. Then select **Invoices** from the dropdown menu.  
2. Select the invoice number of the invoice you’d like to view or claim.  
3. Select the **lowest unclaimed page number** or any page number where the status is **unclaimed**.   
4. After you select a page number, fill out all the required fields on the page. You can select **Save** at any time to save your changes or finish the invoice later.   
5. After you complete all the required fields, review the page to make sure all the information is correct.   
6. Select **Submit** to request payment for your claim. Then you’ll get a message confirming that you’ve successfully submitted your claim.  
7. If you have more pages to claim, select **Next page**. If you want to go back and view all your invoices, select **Return** **to invoice pages**.

{% Callout "note", "undefined" %}After you submit a claim online, you cannot change it. To make any changes to a claim, contact your caseworker and ask them to submit a payment adjustment.{% endCallout %}

#### What to expect next

SSPS processes invoice submissions every night. If you submit an invoice page by 4:30 p.m. PT, SSPS will process your invoice that night. If you submit multiple invoice pages online, SSPS may process some of the pages the following night.

### Get email notifications about your invoices

You can get email notifications when a new invoice is ready for you to claim or review in the SSPS Provider Portal. You’ll also get email notifications for new payments.

#### To get email notifications:

* Select **Provider Information** from the main menu. Then select **Message Center** from the dropdown menu. 
* Select **Send me an email when I have a new message**. After you turn on email notifications, you’ll start getting emails about new invoices and payments.
