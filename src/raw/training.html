Free training and other services are available to help you meet the child or youth’s needs. 

For example, you can sign up for [training on how to use positive methods of guidance](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses/content/parenting-positive-discipline-way) to encourage the child or youth to develop self-control, self-responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and cooperation. 

We partner with the Alliance to provide [trainings for caregivers](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/training). Visit the [Alliance website](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses) to create an account and sign up for trainings at any time.

If you need extra support to meet the child or youth’s needs, let your caseworker know. We’ll try to identify additional services for you.
