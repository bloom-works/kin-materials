You can get free training and other services to help meet the child or youth’s needs. 

We partner with the [Alliance](https://risewiththealliance.org/), a group of organizations that provides [trainings ](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/training)and support to caregivers. Many of the trainings are live or recorded webinars. Some trainings are in-person, group sessions. Visit the[ Alliance website](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses) to create an account and sign up for trainings at any time.

For example, you can sign up for [training on how to use positive methods of guidance](https://cpe.socialwork.uw.edu/alliance-courses/content/parenting-positive-discipline-way) to encourage the child or youth to develop self-control, self-responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and cooperation. 

The Alliance CaRES program provides support groups, peer mentors, and other resources to kinship caregivers. They can also help identify training opportunities. Sign up on the [Alliance CaRES website](https://alliancecares.org/). 

If you need extra support to meet the child or youth’s needs, let your caseworker know. We’ll try to identify additional services for you.
