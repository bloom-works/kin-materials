You can ask us for training to help you meet the child or youth’s needs. 

For example, you can ask for training on how to use positive methods of guidance to encourage the child or youth to develop:

* Self-control
* Self-responsibility
* Self-direction
* Self-esteem
* Cooperation

We partner with Alliance CaRES to provide [training for kinship caregivers](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/training).
