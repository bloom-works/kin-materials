You can ask us for training to help you meet the child or youth’s needs. 

For example, you can ask for training on how to use positive methods of guidance to encourage the child or youth to develop self-control, self-responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and cooperation.

We partner with Alliance CaRES to provide [training for kinship caregivers](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/training).

You can also ask us for in-home or out-of-home services. You may get specific services if you’re eligible and if they’re available in your area. If you need extra support to meet the child or youth’s needs, let your caseworker know, and we’ll identify the right resources for you.
