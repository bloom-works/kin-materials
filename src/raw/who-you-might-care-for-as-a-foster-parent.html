As a foster parent, you work with your licensor to decide how many children and youth you might care for, and what ages and genders work best for your family and home. 

Placements take into consideration your preferences about what kinds of children and youth you want to care for. You are not required to take children or youth into your care.

### How many children and youth you might care for

When you get your license to be a foster parent, the license says how many children and youth can be placed with you at once. It also says what ages and genders they can be. The whole picture of who you can care for is called your “licensed capacity.”

You and your licensor consider several factors when deciding your licensed capacity. Some of the major factors include:

* How many foster parents live in your home
* Each foster parent’s skills and experience
* How much space you have at home
* The likely needs of the children and youth who might be placed with you

Once you have been licensed for six months and shown that you can care for the children and youth who are placed with you, you can request an increase to your licensed capacity. You can also request an increase sooner if you get approval from the licensing division of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).

#### Capacity limits

The typical capacity limits for foster homes are:

* If there is one foster parent, four children or youth can live with you.
* If there are two foster parents, six children or youth can live with you.

You may be licensed for one more child or youth beyond these capacity limits. 

If your home reaches these capacity limits because you become the parent or guardian of an additional child, your licensor will decide whether you can care for one more child or youth.

These additional capacity limits also apply:

* A foster home can have **no more than two children** who are under two years old or who cannot walk.
* A foster home can have **no more than three children or youth** who have any of the following conditions:
* * Developmental disabilities

  * Emotional disorders, with an individual supervision plan developed by DCYF

  * Behavioral disorders

  * Medical needs that qualify the child or youth as medically fragile, meaning that they need specialized care from their foster parent

You can request an exception to these additional capacity limits by showing DCYF that you are able to care for more children and youth.


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
The capacity limits include all children or youth under the age of 18 who live with you, not just foster children. For example, if you have biological or adopted children under the age of 18 living with you, they count toward the capacity limits.

If you foster a parent who is under the age of 18 and their child, both the parent and the child count toward the capacity limits.

#### Exceptions to capacity limits

DCYF can allow you to temporarily go over your licensed capacity if it’s in the best interest of a foster child or youth and any other children or youth in your home.

DCYF can also grant exceptions to capacity limits for emergency placements or placements that support one or more of these outcomes:

* Allowing parenting youth to stay together with their children
* Keeping siblings together
* Placing children or youth with a family that they already have a meaningful relationship with
* Placing children or youth who have severe disabilities with families that can provide the care they need

DCYF will record all exceptions in writing. Some exceptions come with written plans for additional supervision and other requirements, including site-specific supervision plans and individual supervision plans. If your exception comes with additional requirements, you must follow them.

### Deciding not to care for a child or youth

In general, you have the right to decide that you don’t want a specific child or youth to be placed with you. 

There are a few exceptions to this right:

* If your decision goes against a contract with your [Child Placing Agency (CPA)](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/child-placing-agencies/cpa-contacts)
* If your decision violates Washington state discrimination laws. This means that you can’t refuse to care for a child or youth because of their:

  * Race
  * Ethnicity
  * Disability
  * Religion
  * Sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression (SOGIE)[](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/child-placing-agencies/cpa-contacts)

If you decide not to continue caring for a child or youth who has been placed with you, you have to get their caseworker’s approval before moving them to a new placement.
