Children and youth of all ages and backgrounds need foster parents. Many young people leave foster care when they turn 18, but there are also opportunities to support youth up through age 21 as they transition into adulthood.

As a foster parent, you and your licensing worker discuss how many children and youth you might care for, and what ages work best for your family and home. 

Decisions about which specific children and youth are placed with you work differently depending on whether you work with a Child Placing Agency (CPA) or directly with the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). 

* **If you work with a CPA,** the CPA will screen possible placements and decide which children and youth may be good fits for your home. 
* **If you get licensed through DCYF’s Licensing Division,** you work directly with caseworkers to make placement decisions.

## **How many children and youth you might care for**

When you get your license to be a foster parent, the license says how many children and youth can be placed in your home at the same time. It also says what ages they can be. The whole picture of who you can care for is called your “licensed capacity.”

Your licensing worker collaborates with you to understand what works best for your family, then makes the final decision about your licensed capacity. Some of the major factors that go into this decision include:

* How many foster parents live in your home
* Each foster parent’s skills and experience
* How much space you have at home
* The needs of the children and youth who might be placed with you

It’s important to note that the physical space in your home is often the limiting factor in your licensed capacity. The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) has detailed rules about where children can sleep and with whom they can share bedrooms. Even if you are willing and otherwise able to care for additional children and youth, those rules can limit your licensed capacity.

## **Deciding not to care for a child or youth**

You have the right to decide that you don’t want a specific child or youth to be placed with you, unless your decision violates Washington state discrimination laws. This means that you can’t refuse to care for a child or youth because of their:

* Race
* Ethnicity
* Disability
* Religion
* Sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression (SOGIE)

DCYF will work with you to get additional training or support that you might need in order to care for a specific child. 


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
If you decide to stop caring for a child or youth who is placed with you, you have to get their caseworker’s approval before they go to a new placement. You cannot move the child to a different home on your own.
