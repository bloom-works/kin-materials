You have the right and responsibility to allow or not allow your child to participate in typical  childhood activities. 

Typical childhood activities include, but are not limited to: 

* Extracurricular activities
* Enrichment activities 
* Social activities
* Overnight activities where you are not present over 24 hours and up to 72 hours, like school trips 

Use careful and thoughtful decision making when you decide what activities your child can participate in. Prioritize your child’s health, safety, and best interests. Encourage your child’s emotional and developmental growth.

If DCYF or the court created a safety plan, comply with the plan when you decide what to allow your child to do.
