You’ll need to make parenting decisions about when the child or youth in your care can participate in activities. Follow prudent parenting standards when you make these decisions.

Prudent parenting means: 

* Making careful and thoughtful decisions.
* Focusing on the child or youth’s health, safety, and best interests.
* Supporting the child or youth’s emotional and developmental growth.

Use prudent parenting to decide when the child or youth can participate in: 

* Recreational activities or hobbies outside of school.
* Social activities.
* Overnight activities where you are not present over 24 hours and up to 72 hours, like school trips.

If the caseworker or court created a safety plan or a supervision plan, follow the plan when you decide what to allow the child or youth to do.
