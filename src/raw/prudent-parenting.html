As a caregiver, you will need to decide whether to allow your kin child to take part in typical childhood activities. To make these decisions, follow prudent parenting standards.

Prudent parenting means: 

* Using careful and thoughtful decision making.
* Prioritizing your kin child’s health, safety, and best interests. 
* Encouraging your kin child’s emotional and developmental growth.

Use prudent parenting to decide whether to let your kin child take part in: 

* Recreational activities or hobbies outside of school
* Social activities
* Overnight activities where you are not present over 24 hours and up to 72 hours, like school trips 

If DCYF or the court created a safety plan, follow the plan when you decide what to allow your kin child to do.
