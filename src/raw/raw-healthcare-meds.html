As a kin caregiver, one of your main responsibilities is to manage your child’s health needs. From routine health exams to sickness and injury, there are rules you must follow. We’re here to help you understand what your responsibilities are. 

### Immediate health needs

You must schedule certain appointments **immediately after a child is placed in your care**. Appointments include a well-child exam and an initial dental exam. 

For more information, read [what to do immediately after placement](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/caring-for-relatives-child) or review your placement agreement.

### Routine health needs

As a kin caregiver, you are responsible for meeting your child’s routine health needs. 

#### Appointments

You must schedule and take the child to routine appointments, including:

* Well child doctor visits
* Dental exams and cleanings
* Eye exams (as needed)

If your child’s doctor recommends other types of treatment, let your caseworker know before you schedule an appointment. This includes:

* Counseling
* Therapy (behavioral, physical, occupational, speech, etc.)

#### Basic health and hygiene needs

You must make sure your child has basic items to meet their health and hygiene needs. Provide (as needed):

* Diapers and wipes
* Pull ups and absorbent underwear 
* Period products
* Dental braces and retainers
* Bras and binders
* * Glasses

  * Hair and skin care products appropriate to your child’s hair and skin types

You should also help them use these items as needed. 

#### Medicines

You must properly store and give medicines (as needed).

Make sure to give your child:

* Prescription medicine, only as directed by a doctor
* Over-the-counter medicine, as needed, following instructions on the label

Talk to your child’s doctor before regularly using any over-the-counter medicine.

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}Do not use medicine to manage a child’s behavior unless directed by a doctor. This includes the use of Benadryl, Nyquil, or melatonin for sleep or calming.{% endCallout %}

#### Caseworker approval

If there are any changes to your child’s routine health or medicine needs, you must notify your child’s caseworker. 

This includes:

* New prescription medicines
* Changes in prescription medicines or dosing
* New treatment plans or procedures recommended by a doctor
* Non-western or alternative medicines or procedures you’d like to try (e.g. acupuncture, herbs, etc.)

### Consenting to care

#### Ages 18 and up

Youth ages 18 and up will consent to their own medical care, unless you have legal authority to consent for them due to their cognitive needs.

#### Ages 17 and under

For children and youth 17 and under, you are responsible for consenting to health care, including:

* Routine medical, dental, and vision care
* Diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury
* Emergency medical treatment
* Emergency mental health treatment

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}You must get permission to consent for medical care for children in the custody of Tribal court. Ask your child’s caseworker for more information.{% endCallout %}

In certain cases, children and youth must consent to their own medical care. This includes:

* Mental health care (ages 13 and up)
* STD testing and care (ages 14 and up)
* Reproductive care and abortion (all ages)
* Substance use care (all ages)
* Consultations related to gender identity (all ages)

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}We recognize that families have different beliefs about what is age appropriate. However, the age requirements listed here are required by state law.{% endCallout %}

#### Caseworker approval

For certain medical services, you must first get permission from your child’s caseworker. These services are not emergencies, but go beyond routine check-ups. 

Some examples include:

* Surgeries that require anesthesia, such as removal of tonsils, ear tube insertion, or removal of wisdom teeth
* Psychiatric medicines for children under age 13, or those who are not able to give their own consent

{% Callout "note", "Note" %}Your caseworker will need to get approval for these services from your child’s family of origin (or from the court). It can take time to go through these steps. We recommend you talk to your child’s caseworker as soon as you know your child needs one of these services.{% endCallout %}

### Access to medicine

You are responsible for properly storing medicines. Proper storage can vary based on many factors, including your child’s age, behavior, and development. Proper storage may also change over time based on changes to your child’s age, behavior, or development.

#### Limited access

In some cases, you may need to limit access to medicines. DCYF can give you a lock box if you need it.

You might need to limit access to:

* Prescription medicines
* Over-the-counter medicines
* Vitamins or herbal remedies
* Pet medicines

#### Full access

Children or youth may take their own medicine if **one of the following is true**:

* They’re in extended foster care
* They have written approval by both their doctor and caseworker

You must ensure children can access lifesaving medicine they can use safely, including:

* Inhalers
* Insulin
* Epi-Pens
* Naloxone (Narcan)

If there are other children in the household, you need to make sure they cannot access these medicines.

### Questions

Managing your child’s health can be overwhelming. If you have questions or are ever in doubt, contact your child’s caseworker.
