You are responsible for making sure your kin child gets the education they need.

You will need to:

* Follow the educational plan from their caseworker. 
* Enroll them in public or tribal school. 

The only exceptions are if a court order allows your kin child to go to private school, be home schooled, or have an alternative learning experience.
