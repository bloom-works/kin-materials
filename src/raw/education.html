As a caregiver, you need to make sure the child or youth in your care gets the education they need. Work with your caseworker, the school, the foster care liaison, CASA worker, etc. to develop the best plan for their needs.

If possible, we recommend keeping the child or youth enrolled in their current school to help with stability. 

Ask for caseworker guidance before enrolling them in the local public or tribal school.


{% Callout "note", "Note" %}
The caseworker must get a court order to allow the child or youth to go to a private school, be home schooled, or have an alternative learning experience.
