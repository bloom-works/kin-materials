As a kin caregiver, one of your main responsibilities is to manage your child’s health needs. From routine health care to sickness and injury, there are specific guidelines you must follow. We’re here to help you understand what your responsibilities are. 

### Immediate health needs

There are specific health care appointments you must schedule and attend immediately after placement. Review your placement agreement or the [kinship care overview](https://dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/kinship-caregivers/caring-for-relatives-child) for more information.

### Routine health needs

As a kin caregiver, you are responsible for meeting your child’s routine health needs. You must:

* Schedule and take the child to routine appointments  
* Make sure the child has basic items to meet their health and hygiene needs  
* Properly store and give the child medications (as needed)

If there are any changes to your child’s routine health care or medicine needs (including new prescribed medications or changes in prescribed medications or dosing), you must notify your child’s caseworker.

#### Routine appointments

Make sure to schedule and take your child to:

* Well child doctor visits  
* Dental cleanings (every 6 months)  
* Eye exams (as needed)  
* Counseling or therapy appointments (as needed) 

#### Basic health and hygiene needs

Make sure to provide (as needed):

* Diapers and wipes  
* Pull ups and absorbent underwear   
* Glasses  
* Hair care products appropriate to the child’s hair type  
* Period products  
* Dental braces and retainers

You should also help the child use these items as needed. 

#### Medications

Make sure to give the child:

* Prescription medicines, only as directed by a doctor  
* Over-the-counter medicine, as needed, following instructions on the label. Talk to your child’s doctor before regularly using any over-the-counter medicine.

Check with the child’s caseworker before using alternative or non-western medicines or procedures, including herbs and supplements. 

{% Callout %}Do not use medicine to manage a child’s behavior unless directed by a doctor. This includes the use of Benadryl, Nyquil, or melatonin for sleep or calming.{% endCallout %}

### Consenting to care

#### Youth age 18 or over

Youth age 18 or over will consent to their own medical care, unless you have legal authority to consent for them. 

#### Children under age 18

For children under age 18, you are responsible for consenting to health care, including:

* Routine medical, dental, and vision care  
* Diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury  
* Emergency medical or mental health treatment

{% Callout %}You must get permission to consent for medical care for children in the custody of Tribal court. Ask your child’s caseworker for more information.{% endCallout %}

Youth under 18 must consent to their own medical care in certain circumstances, including:

* Mental health care (youth age 13 or over)  
* STD and sexual health care (youth age 14 or over)  
* Reproductive care and abortion  
* Substance use care  
* Consultations related to gender identity

#### Special cases that require caseworker permission

For certain medical services, you must get permission from your child’s caseworker or a court order prior to administering. 

These services are not emergencies, but go beyond routine check-ups. Some examples include:

* Surgeries, such as removal of tonsils, ear tube insertion, or removal of wisdom teeth

* Mind-altering medicine for children under age 13, or those who are not able to give their own consent

{% Callout %}It can take a long time to get approval. Talk to your caseworker as soon as you know these services might be needed.{% endCallout %}

### Access to medicine

You are responsible for properly storing medicine. Proper storage can vary based on many factors, including your child’s age, behavior, and development. 

#### Limited access

In some cases, you may need to limit access to medications. DCYF can give you a lock box if you need it.

You might need to limit access to:

* Prescription medicines  
* Over-the-counter medicines such as vitamins or herbal remedies  
* Pet medicines

#### Full access

Children or youth may take their own medicine if one of the following is true:

* They have written approval by their doctors and caseworkers  
* They’re in the extended foster care program

You must ensure children can access lifesaving medicine they can use safely, including:

* Inhalers  
* Insulin  
* Epi-Pens  
* Naloxone (Narcan)

If there are other children in the household, you need to make sure these medicines are inaccessible to them.
